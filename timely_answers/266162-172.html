<p>From an efficiency perspective, you're not going to beat translate() - it's performing raw string operations in C with a lookup table - there's not much that will beat that bar writing your own C code.
If speed isn't a worry, another option though is:</p>
<pre><code>exclude = set(string.punctuation)
s = ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in exclude)
</code></pre>
<p>This is faster than s.replace with each char, but won't perform as well as non-pure python approaches such as regexes or string.translate, as you can see from the below timings.  For this type of problem, doing it at as low a level as possible pays off.</p>
<p>Timing code:</p>
<pre><code>import re, string, timeit

s = &quot;string. With. Punctuation&quot;
exclude = set(string.punctuation)
table = string.maketrans(&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
regex = re.compile('[%s]' % re.escape(string.punctuation))

def test_set(s):
    return ''.join(ch for ch in s if ch not in exclude)

def test_re(s):  # From Vinko's solution, with fix.
    return regex.sub('', s)

def test_trans(s):
    return s.translate(table, string.punctuation)

def test_repl(s):  # From S.Lott's solution
    for c in string.punctuation:
        s=s.replace(c,&quot;&quot;)
    return s

print &quot;sets      :&quot;,timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_set as f').timeit(1000000)
print &quot;regex     :&quot;,timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_re as f').timeit(1000000)
print &quot;translate :&quot;,timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_trans as f').timeit(1000000)
print &quot;replace   :&quot;,timeit.Timer('f(s)', 'from __main__ import s,test_repl as f').timeit(1000000)
</code></pre>
<p>This gives the following results:</p>
<pre><code>sets      : 19.8566138744
regex     : 6.86155414581
translate : 2.12455511093
replace   : 28.4436721802
</code></pre>
