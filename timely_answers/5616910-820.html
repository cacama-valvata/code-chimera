<p>Use a capturing group inside a lookahead. The lookahead captures the text you're interested in, but the actual match is technically the zero-width substring before the lookahead, so the matches are technically non-overlapping:</p>
<pre><code>import re 
s = &quot;123456789123456789&quot;
matches = re.finditer(r'(?=(\d{10}))', s)
results = [int(match.group(1)) for match in matches]
# results: 
# [1234567891,
#  2345678912,
#  3456789123,
#  4567891234,
#  5678912345,
#  6789123456,
#  7891234567,
#  8912345678,
#  9123456789]
</code></pre>
