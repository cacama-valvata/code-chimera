<p>You are correct that this behavior is related to daylight savings time.  The easiest way to avoid this is to ensure you use a time zone without daylight savings, UTC makes the most sense here.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp()</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/calendar.html#calendar.timegm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>calendar.timegm()</code></a> deal with UTC times, and are exact inverses.</p>
<pre><code>import calendar, datetime

# Convert a unix time u to a datetime object d, and vice versa
def dt(u): return datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(u)
def ut(d): return calendar.timegm(d.timetuple())
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a bit of explanation behind why <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()</code></a> has an issue with daylight savings time, from the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestamp,
such as is returned by <code>time.time()</code>. If optional argument tz is None or
not specified, the timestamp is converted to the platformâ€™s local date
and time, and the returned datetime object is naive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The important part here is that you get a naive <code>datetime.datetime</code> object, which means there is no timezone (or daylight savings) information as a part of the object.  This means that multiple distinct timestamps can map to the same <code>datetime.datetime</code> object when using <code>fromtimestamp()</code>, if you happen to pick times that fall during the daylight savings time roll back:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1004260000) 
datetime.datetime(2001, 10, 28, 1, 6, 40)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1004256400)
datetime.datetime(2001, 10, 28, 1, 6, 40)
</code></pre>
