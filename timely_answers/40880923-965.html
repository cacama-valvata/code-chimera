<p>These answers all collect shallow size information. I suspect that visitors to this question will end up here looking to answer the question, &quot;How big is this complex object in memory?&quot;</p>
<p>There's a great answer here: <a href="https://goshippo.com/blog/measure-real-size-any-python-object/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://goshippo.com/blog/measure-real-size-any-python-object/</a></p>
<p>The punchline:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>import sys

def get_size(obj, seen=None):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Recursively finds size of objects&quot;&quot;&quot;
    size = sys.getsizeof(obj)
    if seen is None:
        seen = set()
    obj_id = id(obj)
    if obj_id in seen:
        return 0
    # Important mark as seen *before* entering recursion to gracefully handle
    # self-referential objects
    seen.add(obj_id)
    if isinstance(obj, dict):
        size += sum([get_size(v, seen) for v in obj.values()])
        size += sum([get_size(k, seen) for k in obj.keys()])
    elif hasattr(obj, '__dict__'):
        size += get_size(obj.__dict__, seen)
    elif hasattr(obj, '__iter__') and not isinstance(obj, (str, bytes, bytearray)):
        size += sum([get_size(i, seen) for i in obj])
    return size
</code></pre>
<p>Used like so:</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: get_size(1)
Out[1]: 24

In [2]: get_size([1])
Out[2]: 104

In [3]: get_size([[1]])
Out[3]: 184
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to know Python's memory model more deeply, there's a great article here that has a similar &quot;total size&quot; snippet of code as part of a longer explanation: <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understand-how-much-memory-your-python-objects-use--cms-25609" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understand-how-much-memory-your-python-objects-use--cms-25609</a></p>
