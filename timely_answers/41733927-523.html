<p>I've had nice results in reading huge files (e.g: ~750 MB igraph object - a binary pickle file) using cPickle itself. This was achieved by simply wrapping up the pickle load call as mentioned <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9270029/2385420">here</a></p>
<p>Example snippet in your case would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>import timeit
import cPickle as pickle
import gc


def load_cpickle_gc():
    output = open('myfile3.pkl', 'rb')

    # disable garbage collector
    gc.disable()

    mydict = pickle.load(output)

    # enable garbage collector again
    gc.enable()
    output.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print &quot;cPickle load (with gc workaround): &quot;
    t = timeit.Timer(stmt=&quot;pickle_wr.load_cpickle_gc()&quot;, setup=&quot;import pickle_wr&quot;)
    print t.timeit(1),'\n'
</code></pre>
<p>Surely, there might be more apt ways to get the task done, however, this workaround does reduce the time required drastically.
(For me, it reduced from 843.04s to 41.28s, around 20x)</p>
