<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>logging.basicConfig()</code></a> can take a keyword argument <code>handlers</code> since Python 3.3, which simplifies logging setup a lot, especially when setting up multiple handlers with the same formatter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><code>handlers</code></strong> – If specified, this should be an iterable of already created handlers to add to the root logger. Any handlers which don’t already have a formatter set will be assigned the default formatter created in this function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole setup can therefore be done with a single call like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format=&quot;%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s&quot;,
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler(&quot;debug.log&quot;),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
</code></pre>
<p>(Or with <code>import sys</code> + <code>StreamHandler(sys.stdout)</code> per original question's requirements – the default for StreamHandler is to write to stderr. Look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LogRecord attributes</a> if you want to customize the log format and add things like filename/line, thread info etc.)</p>
<p>The setup above needs to be done only once near the beginning of the script. You can use the logging from all other places in the codebase later like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>logging.info('Useful message')
logging.error('Something bad happened')
...
</code></pre>
<p>Note: If it doesn't work, someone else has probably already initialized the logging system differently. Comments suggest doing <code>logging.root.handlers = []</code> before the call to <code>basicConfig()</code>.</p>
