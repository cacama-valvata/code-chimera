<p>I needed something to replace regular expressions in docx.
I took scannys answer.
To handle style I've used answer from:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34779724/python-docx-replace-string-in-paragraph-while-keeping-style">Python docx Replace string in paragraph while keeping style</a>
added recursive call to handle nested tables.
and came up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import re
from docx import Document

def docx_replace_regex(doc_obj, regex , replace):

    for p in doc_obj.paragraphs:
        if regex.search(p.text):
            inline = p.runs
            # Loop added to work with runs (strings with same style)
            for i in range(len(inline)):
                if regex.search(inline[i].text):
                    text = regex.sub(replace, inline[i].text)
                    inline[i].text = text

    for table in doc_obj.tables:
        for row in table.rows:
            for cell in row.cells:
                docx_replace_regex(cell, regex , replace)



regex1 = re.compile(r&quot;your regex&quot;)
replace1 = r&quot;your replace string&quot;
filename = &quot;test.docx&quot;
doc = Document(filename)
docx_replace_regex(doc, regex1 , replace1)
doc.save('result1.docx')
</code></pre>
<p>To iterate over dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>for word, replacement in dictionary.items():
    word_re=re.compile(word)
    docx_replace_regex(doc, word_re , replacement)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this solution will replace regex only if whole regex has same style in document.</p>
<p>Also if text is edited after saving same style text might be in separate runs.
For example if you open document that has &quot;testabcd&quot; string and you change it to &quot;test1abcd&quot; and save, even dough its the same style there are 3 separate runs &quot;test&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;abcd&quot;, in this case replacement of test1 won't work.</p>
<p>This is for tracking changes in the document. To marge it to one run, in Word you need to go to &quot;Options&quot;, &quot;Trust Center&quot; and in &quot;Privacy Options&quot; unthick &quot;Store random numbers to improve combine accuracy&quot; and save the document.</p>
