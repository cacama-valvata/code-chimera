<p>This is a simple programming concept called FLAGS. Google it a bit and you will see is quite simple.</p>
<pre><code>all_passed = True
# First test
for filename in first_folder:

    if &quot;Sasha Great&quot; in open(filename).read():
        log.debug(filename + &quot; Done&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;First test failure for &quot; + filename)
        all_passed=False
        continue

if all_passed:
    print('All test passed')
</code></pre>
