<p>Write a generator function that pulls the chunks down and splits them into lines for you. Since you won't know if the last line ended in a newline or not, save it and attach it to the next chunk.</p>
<pre><code>def split_by_lines(text_generator):
    last_line = &quot;&quot;
    try:
        while True:
             chunk = &quot;&quot;.join(last_line, next(text_generator))
             chunk_by_line = chunk.split('\n')
             last_line = chunk_by_line.pop()
             for line in chunk_by_line:
                 yield line
    except StopIteration: # the other end of the pipe is empty
        yield last_line
        raise StopIteration
</code></pre>
