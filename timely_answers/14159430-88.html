<p>I realize that this is an old question...but for people finding there way here via Google:  <code>package_data</code> is a low-down, <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/2011/07/15/lies,-more-lies-and-python-packaging-documentation-on--package_data-/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dirty lie</a>.  It is only used when building <em>binary</em> packages (<code>python setup.py bdist ...</code>) but <em>not</em> when building source packages (<code>python setup.py sdist ...</code>).  This is, of course, ridiculous -- one would expect that building a source distribution would result in a collection of files that could be sent to someone else to built the binary distribution.</p>
<p>In any case, using <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html#manifest-template" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>MANIFEST.in</code></a> will work <em>both</em> for binary and for source distributions.</p>
