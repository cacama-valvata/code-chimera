<p>You're a bit confused on what you're trying to do. Types, also known as classes, are objects, like everything else in python. When you write <code>int</code> in your programs, you're referencing a global variable called <code>int</code> which happens to be a class. What you're trying to do is not &quot;cast string to type&quot;, it's accessing builtin variables by name.</p>
<p>Once you understand that, the solution is easy to see:</p>
<pre><code>def get_builtin(name):
    return getattr(__builtins__, name)
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>If you <em>really</em> wanted to turn a type name into a type object, here's how you'd do it. I use <code>deque</code> to do a breadth-first tree traversal without recursion.</p>
<pre><code>def gettype(name):
    from collections import deque
    # q is short for &quot;queue&quot;, here
    q = deque([object])
    while q:
        t = q.popleft()
        if t.__name__ == name:
            return t
        else:
            print 'not', t

        try:
            # Keep looking!
            q.extend(t.__subclasses__())
        except TypeError:
            # type.__subclasses__ needs an argument, for whatever reason.
            if t is type:
                continue
            else:
                raise
    else:
        raise ValueError('No such type: %r' % name)
</code></pre>
