<p>Oh, I just realized from the screenshot that you're on Windows.  The <code>ForkingMixIn</code> class is not available on Windows because there is no <code>fork()</code> on Windows.  This is also mentioned <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/socketserver.html#socketserver.ForkingMixIn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the docs</a>.</p>
