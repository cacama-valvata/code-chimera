<p>You seem to have already realised this; the remote server is apparently checking the user agent header and rejecting requests from Python's urllib. But <code>urllib.request.urlretrieve()</code> doesn't allow you to change the HTTP headers, however, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.URLopener.retrieve" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urllib.request.URLopener.retrieve()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request

opener = urllib.request.URLopener()
opener.addheader('User-Agent', 'whatever')
filename, headers = opener.retrieve(url, 'Test.pdf')
</code></pre>
<p>N.B. You are using Python 3 and these functions are now considered part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/urllib.request.html#legacy-interface" rel="nofollow noreferrer">&quot;Legacy interface&quot;</a>, and <code>URLopener</code> has been deprecated. For that reason you should not use them in new code.</p>
<p>The above aside, you are going to a lot of trouble to simply access a URL. Your code imports <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>requests</code></a>, but you don't use it - you should though because it is much easier than <code>urllib</code>. This works for me:</p>
<pre><code>import requests

url = 'http://papers.xtremepapers.com/CIE/Cambridge%20IGCSE/Mathematics%20(0580)/0580_s03_qp_1.pdf'
r = requests.get(url)
with open('0580_s03_qp_1.pdf', 'wb') as outfile:
    outfile.write(r.content)
</code></pre>
