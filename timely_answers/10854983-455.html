<p>Gives a UTC offset like in ThomasH's answer, but takes daylight savings into account.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; offset = time.timezone if (time.localtime().tm_isdst == 0) else time.altzone
&gt;&gt;&gt; offset / 60 / 60 * -1
-9
</code></pre>
<p>The value of <code>time.timezone</code> or <code>time.altzone</code> is in seconds West of UTC (with areas East of UTC getting a negative value). This is the opposite to how we'd actually like it, hence the * -1.</p>
<p><code>time.localtime().tm_isdst</code> will be zero if daylight savings is currently not in effect (although this may not be correct if an area has recently changed their daylight savings law).</p>
<p>EDIT: marr75 is correct, I've edited the answer accordingly.</p>
