<p>You could write this in as a function as so:</p>
<pre><code>def window_stack(a, stepsize=1, width=3):
    n = a.shape[0]
    return np.hstack( a[i:1+n+i-width:stepsize] for i in range(0,width) )
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>This doesn't really depend on the shape of the original array, as long as <code>a.ndim = 2</code>.  Note that I never use either lengths in the interactive version.  The second dimension of the shape is irrelevant; each row can be as long as you want.   Thanks to @Jaime's suggestion, you can do it without checking the shape at all:</p>
<pre><code>def window_stack(a, stepsize=1, width=3):
    return np.hstack( a[i:1+i-width or None:stepsize] for i in range(0,width) )
</code></pre>
