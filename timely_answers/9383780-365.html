<p>OK, you've thrown quite a few concepts into the mix here! I'm going to pull out a few of the specific questions you have.</p>
<p>In general, understanding super, the MRO and metclasses is made much more complicated because there have been lots of changes in this tricky area over the last few versions of Python.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's own documentation</a> is a very good reference, and completely up to date. There is an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-pymeta.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IBM developerWorks article</a> which is fine as an introduction and takes a more tutorial-based approach, but note that it's five years old, and spends a lot of time talking about the older-style approaches to meta-classes.</p>
<p><strong><code>super</code></strong> is how you access an object's super-classes. It's more complex than (for example) Java's <code>super</code> keyword, mainly because of multiple inheritance in Python. As <a href="http://fuhm.net/super-harmful/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Super Considered Harmful</a> explains, using <code>super()</code> can result in you implicitly using a chain of super-classes, the order of which is defined by the <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Method Resolution Order</a> (MRO).</p>
<p>You can see the MRO for a class easily by invoking <code>mro()</code> on the class (not on an instance). Note that meta-classes are not in an object's super-class hierarchy.</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/17624/thomas-wouters">Thomas</a>' description of meta-classes <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python">here</a> is excellent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A metaclass is the class of a class.
Like a class defines how an instance
of the class behaves, a metaclass
defines how a class behaves. A class
is an instance of a metaclass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the examples you give, here's what's going on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The call to <code>__new__</code> is being
bubbled up to the next thing in the
MRO. In this case, <code>super(MyType, cls)</code> would resolve to <code>type</code>;
calling <code>type.__new__</code> lets Python
complete it's normal instance
creation steps.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This example is using meta-classes
to enforce a singleton. He's
overriding <code>__call__</code> in the
metaclass so that whenever a class
instance is created, he intercepts
that, and can bypass instance
creation if there already is one
(stored in <code>cls.instance</code>). Note
that overriding <code>__new__</code> in the
metaclass won't be good enough,
because that's only called when
creating the <em>class</em>. Overriding
<code>__new__</code> on the class would work,
however.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This shows a way to dynamically
create a class. Here's he's
appending the supplied class's name
to the created class name, and
adding it to the class hierarchy
too.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what sort of code example you're looking for, but here's a brief one showing meta-classes, inheritance and method resolution:</p>
<pre><code>class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print &quot;meta: creating %s %s&quot; % (name, bases)
        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)
        
    def meta_meth(cls):
        print &quot;MyMeta.meta_meth&quot;
        
    __repr__ = lambda c: c.__name__

class A(object):
    __metaclass__ = MyMeta
    def __init__(self):
        super(A, self).__init__()
        print &quot;A init&quot;
        
    def meth(self):
        print &quot;A.meth&quot;

class B(object):
    __metaclass__ = MyMeta
    def __init__(self):
        super(B, self).__init__()
        print &quot;B init&quot;
        
    def meth(self):
        print &quot;B.meth&quot;

class C(A, B):
    __metaclass__ = MyMeta
    def __init__(self):
        super(C, self).__init__()
        print &quot;C init&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; c_obj = C()
meta: creating A (&lt;type 'object'&gt;,)
meta: creating B (&lt;type 'object'&gt;,)
meta: creating C (A, B)
B init
A init
C init
&gt;&gt;&gt; c_obj.meth()
A.meth
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.meta_meth()
MyMeta.meta_meth
&gt;&gt;&gt; c_obj.meta_meth()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;mro.py&quot;, line 38, in &lt;module&gt;
    c_obj.meta_meth()
AttributeError: 'C' object has no attribute 'meta_meth'
</code></pre>
