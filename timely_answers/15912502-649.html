<p>There is no way to tell Sphinx to exclude some imports. When using autodoc, all documented modules must be cleanly importable.</p>
<p>You might be able to work around the problem by doing some <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock/1.0.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mocking</a>. Here is an article describing the solution to a problem that seems quite similar to yours: <a href="http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-to-make-your-sphinx-documentation-compile-with-readthedocs-when-youre-using-numpy-and-scipy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-to-make-your-sphinx-documentation-compile-with-readthedocs-when-youre-using-numpy-and-scipy/</a>. Here is a small code sample (intended to be added to conf.py):</p>
<pre><code>import mock

MOCK_MODULES = ['numpy', 'matplotlib', 'matplotlib.pyplot']
for mod_name in MOCK_MODULES:
    sys.modules[mod_name] = mock.Mock()
</code></pre>
<p>You might might need to install python-mock for the above to work: <code>sudo apt-get install python-mock</code></p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Since Sphinx 1.3, it is easier to set up the mocking. Just add the modules to be mocked to the <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_mock_imports" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>autodoc_mock_imports</code></a> configuration value.</p>
