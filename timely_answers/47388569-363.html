<p>Had same problem and this worked for me.</p>
<p>Suppose the date column in your dataset is called &quot;date&quot;</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

df['Dates'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']).dt.date
df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date']).dt.time
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you two columns &quot;Dates&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; with splited dates.</p>
