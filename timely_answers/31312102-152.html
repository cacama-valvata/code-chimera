<p>Happy Leap Second has it close but I kept getting an automatic casting to string.
Also if you check out this other post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3425320/sqlite3-programmingerror-you-must-not-use-8-bit-bytestrings-unless-you-use-a-te">a fun debate on using buffer or Binary to push non text data into sqlite</a> you see that the documented approach is to avoid the buffer all together and use this chunk of code.</p>
<pre><code>def adapt_array(arr):
    out = io.BytesIO()
    np.save(out, arr)
    out.seek(0)
    return sqlite3.Binary(out.read()
</code></pre>
<p>I haven't heavily tested this in python 3, but it seems to work in python 2.7</p>
