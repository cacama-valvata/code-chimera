<p>This will not only change the max_retries but also enable a backoff strategy which makes requests to all <em>http://</em> addresses sleep for a period of time before retrying (to a total of 5 times):</p>
<pre><code>import requests
from requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter

s = requests.Session()

retries = Retry(total=5,
                backoff_factor=0.1,
                status_forcelist=[ 500, 502, 503, 504 ])

s.mount('http://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))

s.get('http://httpstat.us/500')
</code></pre>
<p>As per <a href="http://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.util.html#module-urllib3.util.retry" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for Retry</a>: if the backoff_factor is 0.1, then sleep() will sleep for [0.1s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. It will also force a retry if the status code returned is 500, 502, 503 or 504.</p>
<p>Various other options to Retry allow for more granular control:</p>
<ul>
<li>total – Total number of retries to allow.</li>
<li>connect – How many connection-related errors to retry on.</li>
<li>read – How many times to retry on read errors.</li>
<li>redirect – How many redirects to perform.</li>
<li>method_whitelist – Set of uppercased HTTP method verbs that we should retry on.</li>
<li>status_forcelist – A set of HTTP status codes that we should force a retry on.</li>
<li>backoff_factor – A backoff factor to apply between attempts.</li>
<li>raise_on_redirect – Whether, if the number of redirects is exhausted, to raise a MaxRetryError, or to return a response with a response code in the 3xx range.</li>
<li>raise_on_status – Similar meaning to raise_on_redirect: whether we should raise an exception, or return a response, if status falls in status_forcelist range and retries have been exhausted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: <em>raise_on_status</em> is relatively new, and has not made it into a release of urllib3 or requests yet.</p>
<p>To make requests retry on specific HTTP status codes, use status_forcelist. For example, status_forcelist=[503] will retry on status code 503 (service unavailable).</p>
<p>By default, the retry only fires for these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could not get a connection from the pool.</li>
<li>TimeoutError</li>
<li>HTTPException raised (from http.client in Python 3 else httplib).
This seems to be low-level HTTP exceptions, like URL or protocol not
formed correctly.</li>
<li>SocketError</li>
<li>ProtocolError</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that these are all exceptions that prevent a regular HTTP response from being received. If <strong>any</strong> regular response is generated, no retry is done. Without using the status_forcelist, even a response with status 500 will not be retried.</p>
<p>To make it behave in a manner which is more intuitive for working with a remote API or web server, I would use the above code snippet, which forces retries on statuses 500, 502, 503 and 504, all of which are not uncommon on the web and (possibly) recoverable given a big enough backoff period.</p>
