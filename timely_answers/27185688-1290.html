<p>There was an <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue8776" rel="nofollow noreferrer">issue on the Python bug tracker</a> about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In some situations, the encoding of the command line is incorrect or
unknown. sys.argv is decoded with the file system encoding which can
be wrong. Eg. see issue #4388 (ok, it's a bug, it should be fixed).</p>
<p>As os.environb, it would be useful to have bytes version of sys.argv
to have able to decide the encoding used to decode each argument, or
to manipulate bytes if we don't care about the encoding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since on Python 3 <code>sys.argv</code> is encoded with the filesystem encoding, the proposed solution on the bug is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.fsencode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.fsencode</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>argvb = list(map(os.fsencode, sys.argv))
</code></pre>
<p><code>os.fsencode</code> encodes the string using the string using the <code>surrogateescape</code> encoding, which is defined in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0383" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-383</a>.</p>
