<li>The accepted solution won't work directly for python3 - it will need an <code>from functools import reduce</code>.</li>
<li>Also it seems more pythonic to use a <code>for</code> loop.

<p>Removed <code>reduce()</code>. Use <code>functools.reduce()</code> if you really need it; however, 99 percent of the time an explicit <code>for</code> loop is more readable.
3. Next, the accepted solution doesn't set non-existing nested keys (it returns a <code>KeyError</code>) - see @eafit's answer for a solution</p>

<p>So why not use the suggested method from kolergy's question for getting a value:</p>
<pre><code>def getFromDict(dataDict, mapList):    
    for k in mapList: dataDict = dataDict[k]
    return dataDict
</code></pre>
<p>And the code from @eafit's answer for setting a value:</p>
<pre><code>def nested_set(dic, keys, value):
    for key in keys[:-1]:
        dic = dic.setdefault(key, {})
    dic[keys[-1]] = value
</code></pre>
<p>Both work straight in python 2 and 3</p>
