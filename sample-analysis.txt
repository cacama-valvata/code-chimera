to count answer links:

rg --files-with-matches 'stackoverflow\.com/a' samples

(or rg -l for short)


similar for /q for questions and /[^aq] for neither (aka useless)

==========================

Categories:

useless ones
- other_link: not a question or answer
- question: only links to question
- verbatim: copied code verbatim from SO
- dead: dead answer link
- notcode: not a code answer
  - ex: answer 40674915 - locations of chrome.exe on various versions of windows

idk?
- notpython: code, but not python
  - ex: answer 2039745 is C++, but logic is ported to python
    - corresponding sample is wkentaro_labelme... - might be more interesting actually?
- reasoning (?): answer has code, but not taken by sample
  - ex: wstchhwp_YOLO... - link "to avoid TypeSpec related error" mentioned in answer, but code isn't taken
  - unsure of this one, might be better suited to notcode but idk if we want to differentiate

interesting:
- looked: looked at it, more analysis required
- structurally_equivalent: code is very similar, stuff may be moved around
  - ex: zeek_btest... `which` function is verbatim with two exceptions: import move & variable names
- identifiers: only identifiers changed (function/variable names)
- slightly_different: some slight changes to code, but functionality is otherwise effectively the same
  - ex: yub3r_before... - different python 3 check & no read from buffer, but else branch verbatim sans comments

- (NULL: not looked at yet)

multiple tags for a single file: use slashes (e.g. `other_link/question`)

THINGS TO PROBABLY IGNORE:
- comments: unless they steal them too ig??

==========================

Querying DB:

to avoid working on the same stuff prob do different ASC/DESC (haha binary file diffs):
`SELECT rowid, file FROM samples WHERE classification IS NULL ORDER BY rowid DESC LIMIT 10;`

==========================

specific sample changes:

241506: changed function name but nothing else (not even formatting)
264303: changed return value/ordering of statements from example but otherwise followed
295466: slugify -> _slugify, turned into method, otherwise the same (even stole docstring lmfao)
576816: lua script???

==========================

other notes:

- why do we have 4 things from vignywang lmfao, they're all the same too
