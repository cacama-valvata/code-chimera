to count answer links:

rg --files-with-matches 'stackoverflow\.com/a' samples

(or rg -l for short)


similar for /q for questions and /[^aq] for neither (aka useless)

==========================

Categories:

useless ones
- other_link: not a question or answer
- question: only links to question
- verbatim: copied code verbatim from SO
- dead: dead answer link
- notcode: not a code answer
  - ex: answer 40674915 - locations of chrome.exe on various versions of windows

idk?
- notpython: code, but not python
  - ex: answer 2039745 is C++, but logic is ported to python
    - corresponding sample is wkentaro_labelme... - might be more interesting actually?
- reasoning (?): answer has code, but not taken by sample
  - ex: wstchhwp_YOLO... - link "to avoid TypeSpec related error" mentioned in answer, but code isn't taken
  - unsure of this one, might be better suited to notcode but idk if we want to differentiate
- multiple: multiple answers linked to, actual tags follow (slash separating ofc)
  - separate classes for each answer by // (two slashes)
- extra_info (?): code/explanations for the end user 

interesting:
- looked: looked at it, more analysis required
- structurally_equivalent: code is very similar, stuff may be moved around
  - ex: zeek_btest... `which` function is verbatim with two exceptions: import move & variable names
- identifiers: only identifiers changed (function/variable names)
- slightly_different: some slight changes to code, but functionality is otherwise effectively the same
  - ex: yub3r_before... - different python 3 check & no read from buffer, but else branch verbatim sans comments
- additions: kept original code, but added e.g. function parameters or other logic
  - ex: snorkel-team_snorkel-extraction... - _connection func preserves Retry constructor (with more args) & mount call with additional trust_env macos thing
- security: security-related in some way
  - ex: none yet as far as I can remember
- subset: took subset of code from SO answer, but otherwise verbatim

- (NULL: not looked at yet)

multiple tags for a single file: use slashes (e.g. `other_link/question`)

THINGS TO PROBABLY IGNORE:
- comments: unless they steal them too ig??
- type annotations: down to preference kinda, don't change functionality (or do anything really)

==========================

Querying DB:

to avoid working on the same stuff prob do different ASC/DESC (haha binary file diffs):
`SELECT rowid, file FROM samples WHERE classification IS NULL ORDER BY rowid DESC LIMIT 10;`

==========================

specific sample changes:

241506: changed function name but nothing else (not even formatting)
264303: changed return value/ordering of statements from example but otherwise followed
295466: slugify -> _slugify, turned into method, otherwise the same (even stole docstring lmfao)
576816: lua script???

==========================

other notes:

- why do we have 4 things from vignywang lmfao, they're all the same too
- gnuppie/proxmark3 has a couple duplicate output_grabber.py files in samples
- mcmtroffaes has a couple duplicate entries for bfs.py

- answer 63839503 is a read for sure lol
- kennyhngo_Wizard101_DanceBot... copy pasted comments with links to other SO answers lol
- isiglobal_gifmaker... link hehe

==========================

sample notes:

- sample 1234/1244 (RC_RL_blob_a1...) are the same for 2 users

==========================

duplicate occurences of answers:

- meta: begs question of inclusion just due to forks or maybe stealing code from other github repos?

- mikepqr/resume.md is forked by 5 people in the dataset - see https://github.com/mikepqr/resume.md/blob/6a9525b5cc3c85045c48f3e607f0e0cd176dfb81/resume.py#L40C31-L40C34
  - (answer link is the same)
- answer 2039745 (QT HTMLDelegate) is independently referenced by 5 people?
- answer 35504626 appears in 5 samples (requests backoff strategy?)
- answer 38939320 (binary stdin) referenced for patriotctf2022 (twice) and TFTP stuff (twice)
  - seem to have been copied from each other (sole function in file, same python3 that's different than SO)
- answer 59937363 - sphinx bibtex thing? same exact comment
- answer 13891070 - time.time() reference used in *_MAFIA-USERBOT (or anobotz)
- answers 67303315/31174427/6027615 - trlx/utils/modeling.py in 5 repos (3 utility functions)
- answer 1870254 - utilities/helper.py (sizeof_fmt() function)
- answer 3460942 - kabass_commcare-hq{,-path} both have corehq/util/models.py with TruncatingCharField
- answer 38888131 - windows...things? "ended up just reading all the C documentation because it was more useful"
- answer 54931135 - AWS IAM loading into Neo4j? 2 repos, path is Aaia/actions/aws/load/data/iam.py

==========================

z min: ~526 (for 151 analyzed)
