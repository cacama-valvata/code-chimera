The `webdriver` will wait for a page to load by default via `.get()` method.

As you may be looking for some specific element as @user227215 said, you should use `WebDriverWait` to wait for an element located in your page:

	from selenium import webdriver
	from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
	from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
	from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException

	browser = webdriver.Firefox()
	browser.get("url")
    delay = 3 # seconds
	try:
		myElem = WebDriverWait(browser, delay).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'IdOfMyElement')))
		print "Page is ready!"
	except TimeoutException:
		print "Loading took too much time!"

I have used it for checking alerts. You can use any other type methods to find the locator. 

**EDIT 1:**

I should mention that the `webdriver` will wait for a page to load by default. It does not wait for loading inside frames or for ajax requests. It means when you use `.get('url')`, your browser will wait until the page is completely loaded and then go to the next command in the code. But when you are posting an ajax request, `webdriver` does not wait and it's your responsibility to wait an appropriate amount of time for the page or a part of page to load; so there is a module named `expected_conditions`.
