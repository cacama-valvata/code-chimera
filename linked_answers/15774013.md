Putting together Alex Martelli's answer and Rob Young's comment you get the following code:

    from copy import copy, deepcopy
    
    class A(object):
        def __init__(self):
            print 'init'
            self.v = 10
            self.z = [2,3,4]
    
        def __copy__(self):
            cls = self.__class__
            result = cls.__new__(cls)
            result.__dict__.update(self.__dict__)
            return result
        
        def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
            cls = self.__class__
            result = cls.__new__(cls)
            memo[id(self)] = result
            for k, v in self.__dict__.items():
                setattr(result, k, deepcopy(v, memo))
            return result
                
    a = A()
    a.v = 11
    b1, b2 = copy(a), deepcopy(a)
    a.v = 12
    a.z.append(5)
    print b1.v, b1.z
    print b2.v, b2.z

prints

    init
    11 [2, 3, 4, 5]
    11 [2, 3, 4]

here `__deepcopy__` fills in the `memo` dict to avoid excess copying in case the object itself is referenced from its member.
