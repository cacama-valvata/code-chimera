Roughly as fast as Luka Rahne's answer, but shorter & simpler, IMHO.

    def unique_permutations(elements):
        if len(elements) == 1:
            yield (elements[0],)
        else:
            unique_elements = set(elements)
            for first_element in unique_elements:
                remaining_elements = list(elements)
                remaining_elements.remove(first_element)
                for sub_permutation in unique_permutations(remaining_elements):
                    yield (first_element,) + sub_permutation
    
    >>> list(unique_permutations((1,2,3,1)))
    [(1, 1, 2, 3), (1, 1, 3, 2), (1, 2, 1, 3), ... , (3, 1, 2, 1), (3, 2, 1, 1)]

It works recursively by setting the first element (iterating through all unique elements), and iterating through the permutations for all remaining elements.

Let's go through the `unique_permutations` of (1,2,3,1) to see how it works:

* `unique_elements` are 1,2,3
* Let's iterate through them: `first_element` starts with 1.
  * `remaining_elements` are [2,3,1] (ie. 1,2,3,1 minus the first 1)
  * We iterate (recursively) through the permutations of the remaining elements: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)
  * For each `sub_permutation`, we insert the `first_element`: (**1**,1,2,3), (**1**,1,3,2), ... and yield the result.
* Now we iterate to `first_element` = 2, and do the same as above.
  * `remaining_elements` are [1,3,1] (ie. 1,2,3,1 minus the first 2)
  * We iterate through the permutations of the remaining elements: (1, 1, 3), (1, 3, 1), (3, 1, 1)
  * For each `sub_permutation`, we insert the `first_element`: (**2**, 1, 1, 3), (**2**, 1, 3, 1), (**2**, 3, 1, 1)... and yield the result.
* Finally, we do the same with `first_element` = 3.
