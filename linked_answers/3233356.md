@FM's answer has the right general idea, i.e. a recursive solution, but somewhat peculiar coding and at least one bug.  I'd recommend, instead:

Python 2:

    import collections
    
    def update(d, u):
        for k, v in u.iteritems():
            if isinstance(v, collections.Mapping):
                d[k] = update(d.get(k, {}), v)
            else:
                d[k] = v
        return d
    
Python 3:


    import collections.abc
    
    def update(d, u):
        for k, v in u.items():
            if isinstance(v, collections.abc.Mapping):
                d[k] = update(d.get(k, {}), v)
            else:
                d[k] = v
        return d

The bug shows up when the "update" has a `k`, `v` item where `v` is a `dict` and `k` is not originally a key in the dictionary being updated -- @FM's code "skips" this part of the update (because it performs it on an empty new `dict` which isn't saved or returned anywhere, just lost when the recursive call returns).

My other changes are minor: there is no reason for the `if`/`else` construct when `.get` does the same job faster and cleaner, and `isinstance` is best applied to abstract base classes (not concrete ones) for generality.
