`Popen.communicate` will set the `returncode` attribute when it's done(*). Here's the relevant documentation section:

    Popen.returncode 
      The child return code, set by poll() and wait() (and indirectly by communicate()). 
      A None value indicates that the process hasnâ€™t terminated yet.
    
      A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal N (Unix only).

So you can just do (I didn't test it but it should work):

    import subprocess as sp
    child = sp.Popen(openRTSP + opts.split(), stdout=sp.PIPE)
    streamdata = child.communicate()[0]
    rc = child.returncode

----

(*) This happens because of the way it's implemented: after setting up threads to read the child's streams, it just calls `wait`.
