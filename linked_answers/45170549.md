Answering my own question. It seems one way of performing this is to define an auxillary `__members` function and to use that in defining `__hash__` and `__eq__`. This way, there is no duplication:

    class MyClass(object):
        def __init__(self, a, b):
            self.a = a
            self.b = b
    
        def __members(self):
            return (self.a, self.b)
    
        def __eq__(self, other):
            if type(other) is type(self):
                return self.__members() == other.__members()
            else:
                return False
    
        def __hash__(self):
            return hash(self.__members())
