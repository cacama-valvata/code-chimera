One use is  using the name to reopen the file:

    open(f.name).read()

I use the name attribute when changing a file content using a [NamedTemporaryFile][1] to write the updated content to then replace the original file with [`shutil.move`][2]:

    with open("foo.txt") as f, NamedTemporaryFile("w", dir=".", delete=False) as temp:
        for line in f:
            if stuff:
                temp.write("stuff")
    
    shutil.move(temp.name, "foo.txt")

Also as commented you can use the `f.closed` to see if the file is *really* closed.
