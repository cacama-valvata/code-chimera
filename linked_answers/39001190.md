Using `Q(pk__in=[])` seems to be a good way to represent this idiom.

As indicated by @fwip and comments below: Django's ORM nicely recognises this case, knowing this always evaluates to `FALSE`.  For example:
```python
FooBar.objects.filter(Q(pk__in=[]))
```
correctly returns an empty `QuerySet` without involving any round trip to the database.  While:
```python
FooBar.objects.filter(
  (Q(pk__in=[]) & Q(foo="bar")) |
  Q(hello="world")
)
```
is optimised down to:
```python
FooBar.objects.filter(
  Q(hello="world")
)
```
i.e. it recognises that `Q(pk__in=[])` is always `FALSE`, hence the `AND` condition can never be `TRUE`, so is removed.
