<p>This one works except for leaving the first word as lowercase.</p>

<pre><code>def convert(word):
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() or '_' for x in word.split('_'))
</code></pre>

<p>(I know this isn't exactly what you asked for, and this thread is quite old, but since it's quite prominent when searching for such conversions on Google I thought I'd add my solution in case it helps anyone else).</p>
