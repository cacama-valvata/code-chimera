I encountered same issue and found none of the answers previously provided here would work. Maybe this issue had been solved long ago to Ramnath Reddy, but I could not find the correct answer anywhere online. 

Luckily, I found a solution from a colleague's code by adding the following lines before `logging.basicConfig()`. 

```python
# Remove all handlers associated with the root logger object.
for handler in logging.root.handlers[:]:
    logging.root.removeHandler(handler)
```
Try and see if it helps for whomever had the same issue.

**Python 3.8:** A new option, `force`, has been made available to automatically remove the root handlers while calling `basicConfig()`.  
For example:
```python
logging.basicConfig(filename='ramexample.log', level=logging.DEBUG, force=True)`
```

See [logging.basicConfig][1] parameters:
> force: If this keyword argument is specified as true, any existing handlers attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before carrying out the configuration as specified by the other arguments.
