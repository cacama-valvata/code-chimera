It is not possible to obtain the value of chi^2 from `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` directly without manual calculations. It is possible to get additional output from `curve_fit` besides `popt` and `pcov` by providing the argument `full_output=True`, but the additional output does not contain the value of chi^2. (The additional output is documented e.g. at `leastsq` [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.leastsq.html#scipy.optimize.leastsq)).

In the case where `sigma` is a MxM array, the definition of the chi^2 function minimized by curve_fit is slightly different. 
In this case, `curve_fit` minimizes the function `r.T @ inv(sigma) @ r`, where `r = ydata - f(xdata, *popt)`, instead of `chisq = sum((r / sigma) ** 2)` in the case of one dimensional `sigma`, see the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html) of the parameter `sigma`.
So you should also be able to calculate chi^2 in your case by using `r.T @ inv(sigma) @ r` with your optimized parameters.

An alternative would be to use another package, for example [lmfit][1], where the value of chi square can be directly obtained from the fit result:

    from lmfit.models import GaussianModel
    
    model = GaussianModel()
    
    # create parameters with initial guesses:
    params = model.make_params(center=9, amplitude=40, sigma=1)  
    
    result = model.fit(n, params, x=centers)
    print(result.chisqr)
