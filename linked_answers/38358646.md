You'd use [`urllib.request.urlretrieve`][1].  Note that this function "may become deprecated at some point in the future", so you might be better off using the less likely to be deprecated interface:

    # Adapted from the source:
    # https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/urllib/request.py#l170
    with open(filename, 'wb') as out_file:
        with contextlib.closing(urllib.request.urlopen(url)) as fp:
            block_size = 1024 * 8
            while True:
                block = fp.read(block_size)
                if not block:
                    break
                out_file.write(block)

For small enough files, you could just `read` and `write` the whole thing and drop the loop entirely.
