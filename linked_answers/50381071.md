A possibly a bit better solution compared to the accepted answer:

    from better_abc import ABCMeta, abstract_attribute    # see below

    class AbstractFoo(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    
        @abstract_attribute
        def bar(self):
            pass
    
    class Foo(AbstractFoo):
        def __init__(self):
            self.bar = 3
 
    class BadFoo(AbstractFoo):
        def __init__(self):
            pass

It will behave like this:

    Foo()     # ok
    BadFoo()  # will raise: NotImplementedError: Can't instantiate abstract class BadFoo
    # with abstract attributes: bar

This answer uses same approach as the accepted answer, but integrates well with built-in ABC and does not require boilerplate of `check_bar()` helpers.

Here is the `better_abc.py` content:

    from abc import ABCMeta as NativeABCMeta
    
    class DummyAttribute:
        pass
    
    def abstract_attribute(obj=None):
        if obj is None:
            obj = DummyAttribute()
        obj.__is_abstract_attribute__ = True
        return obj
    
    
    class ABCMeta(NativeABCMeta):
    
        def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            instance = NativeABCMeta.__call__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            abstract_attributes = {
                name
                for name in dir(instance)
                if hasattr(getattr(instance, name), '__is_abstract_attribute__')
            }
            if abstract_attributes:
                raise NotImplementedError(
                    "Can't instantiate abstract class {} with"
                    " abstract attributes: {}".format(
                        cls.__name__,
                        ', '.join(abstract_attributes)
                    )
                )
            return instance

The nice thing is that you can do:


    class AbstractFoo(metaclass=ABCMeta):
        bar = abstract_attribute()

and it will work same as above.

Also one can use:

    class ABC(ABCMeta):
        pass

to define custom ABC helper. PS. I consider this code to be CC0.

This could be improved by using AST parser to raise earlier (on class declaration) by scanning the `__init__` code, but it seems to be an overkill for now (unless someone is willing to implement). 

### 2021: typing support

You can use:

```python
from typing import cast, Any, Callable, TypeVar


R = TypeVar('R')


def abstract_attribute(obj: Callable[[Any], R] = None) -> R:
    _obj = cast(Any, obj)
    if obj is None:
        _obj = DummyAttribute()
    _obj.__is_abstract_attribute__ = True
    return cast(R, _obj)
```

which will let mypy highlight some typing issues

```python
class AbstractFooTyped(metaclass=ABCMeta):

    @abstract_attribute
    def bar(self) -> int:
        pass


class FooTyped(AbstractFooTyped):
    def __init__(self):
        # skipping assignment (which is required!) to demonstrate
        # that it works independent of when the assignment is made
        pass


f_typed = FooTyped()
_ = f_typed.bar + 'test'   # Mypy: Unsupported operand types for + ("int" and "str")


FooTyped.bar = 'test'    # Mypy: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "str", variable has type "int")
FooTyped.bar + 'test'    # Mypy: Unsupported operand types for + ("int" and "str")
```

and for the shorthand notation, as suggested by @SMiller in the comments:

```
class AbstractFooTypedShorthand(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    bar: int = abstract_attribute()


AbstractFooTypedShorthand.bar += 'test'   # Mypy: Unsupported operand types for + ("int" and "str")
```
