So I needed to convert a whole file with bunch of snake case parameters into camel case. The solution by [Mathieu Rodic][1] worked best. Thanks.

Here is a little script to use it on files.

    import re

    f = open("in.txt", "r")
    words = f.read()

    def to_camel_case3(s):
        return re.sub(r'_([a-z])', lambda x: x.group(1).upper(), s)

    f = open("out.txt", "w")
    f.write(to_camel_case3(words))
