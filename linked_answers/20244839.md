Modify your `center` method to be as follows:

    def center(self):
        frameGm = self.frameGeometry()
        screen = QtGui.QApplication.desktop().screenNumber(QtGui.QApplication.desktop().cursor().pos())
        centerPoint = QtGui.QApplication.desktop().screenGeometry(screen).center()
        frameGm.moveCenter(centerPoint)
        self.move(frameGm.topLeft())

This function is based on where the mouse point is located. It uses the [screenNumber][1] function to determine which screen the mouse is current active on. It then finds the [screenGeometry][2] of that monitor and the center point of that screen. Using this method, you should be able to place the window in the center of a screen even if monitor resolutions are different.
