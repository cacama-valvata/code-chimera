## Python 2.6+ and Python 3:

If you want `StopIteration` to be raised if no matching element is found:
```python
next(x for x in the_iterable if x > 3)
```
If you want `default_value` (e.g. `None`) to be returned instead:
```python
next((x for x in the_iterable if x > 3), default_value)
```
  
Note that you need an extra pair of parentheses around the generator expression in this case âˆ’ they are needed whenever the generator expression isn't the only argument.

I see most answers resolutely ignore the [`next`][1] built-in and so I assume that for some mysterious reason they're 100% focused on versions 2.5 and older -- without mentioning the Python-version issue (but then I don't see that mention in the answers that _do_ mention the `next` built-in, which is why I thought it necessary to provide an answer myself -- at least the "correct version" issue gets on record this way;-).

## Python <= 2.5
The [`.next()`][2] method of iterators immediately raises `StopIteration` if the iterator immediately finishes -- i.e., for your use case, if no item in the iterable satisfies the condition.  If you don't care (i.e., you know there **must** be at least one satisfactory item) then just use `.next()` (best on a genexp, line for the `next` built-in in Python 2.6 and better).

If you _do_ care, wrapping things in a function as you had first indicated in your Q seems best, and while the function implementation you proposed is just fine, you could alternatively use `itertools`, a `for...: break` loop, or a genexp, or a `try/except StopIteration` as the function's body, as various answers suggested.  There's not much added value in any of these alternatives so I'd go for the starkly-simple version you first proposed.
