# For non-edge-cases:

If `argv` is anything *approximating* reasonable command-line arguments, the following should be serviceable (and the most idiomatic way to access them, to boot):

	list(map(os.fsencode, sys.argv))

(h/t vstinner from the below discussion)

# For edge-cases: impossible+`wontfix`

> Today I regret `os.environb` (I added it). If I remember correctly, `os.environb` was added before the PEP 383 (`surrogateescape`). This PEP makes `os.environb` almost useless. In Python 3, Unicode is the natural choice, and thanks to the PEP 383, it's still possible to use any "raw bytes".

while his "one line" fails on edge cases (such as where an element of the true `argv` contains a bytestring such as `0x313233c3bf414243c3a2c298c2ba00`), it works in the proverbial 99.9% of use-cases.
