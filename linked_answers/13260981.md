You are correct that this behavior is related to daylight savings time.  The easiest way to avoid this is to ensure you use a time zone without daylight savings, UTC makes the most sense here.

[`datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`][1] and [`calendar.timegm()`][2] deal with UTC times, and are exact inverses.

    import calendar, datetime
    
    # Convert a unix time u to a datetime object d, and vice versa
    def dt(u): return datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(u)
    def ut(d): return calendar.timegm(d.timetuple())

Here is a bit of explanation behind why [`datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()`][3] has an issue with daylight savings time, from the docs:

> Return the local date and time corresponding to the POSIX timestamp,
> such as is returned by `time.time()`. If optional argument tz is None or
> not specified, the timestamp is converted to the platformâ€™s local date
> and time, and the returned datetime object is naive.


The important part here is that you get a naive `datetime.datetime` object, which means there is no timezone (or daylight savings) information as a part of the object.  This means that multiple distinct timestamps can map to the same `datetime.datetime` object when using `fromtimestamp()`, if you happen to pick times that fall during the daylight savings time roll back:

    >>> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1004260000) 
    datetime.datetime(2001, 10, 28, 1, 6, 40)
    >>> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1004256400)
    datetime.datetime(2001, 10, 28, 1, 6, 40)
