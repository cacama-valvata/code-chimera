Maybe [`collections.Counter`][1] could solve your problem:


    from collections import Counter
    Counter(elem[0] for elem in list1)

returns

    Counter({'12392': 2, '7862': 1})


It is fast since it iterates over your list just once. You iterate over entries and then try to get a count of these entries within your list. That cannot be done with `.count`, but might be done as follows:

    for entry in list1:
        print(sum(1 for elem in list1 if elem[0] == entry[0]))


But seriously, have a look at `collections.Counter`.



**EDIT**: *I actually need the total amount of entries which has a value more than 1.*

You can still use the `Counter`:

    c = Counter(elem[0] for elem in list1)
    sum(v for k, v in c.iteritems() if v > 1)

returns `2`, i.e. the sum of counts that are higher than 1.
