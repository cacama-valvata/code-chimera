You seem to have already realised this; the remote server is apparently checking the user agent header and rejecting requests from Python's urllib. But `urllib.request.urlretrieve()` doesn't allow you to change the HTTP headers, however, you can use [`urllib.request.URLopener.retrieve()`][1]:

    import urllib.request
    
    opener = urllib.request.URLopener()
    opener.addheader('User-Agent', 'whatever')
    filename, headers = opener.retrieve(url, 'Test.pdf')

N.B. You are using Python 3 and these functions are now considered part of the ["Legacy interface"][2], and `URLopener` has been deprecated. For that reason you should not use them in new code.

The above aside, you are going to a lot of trouble to simply access a URL. Your code imports [`requests`][3], but you don't use it - you should though because it is much easier than `urllib`. This works for me:

    import requests
    
    url = 'http://papers.xtremepapers.com/CIE/Cambridge%20IGCSE/Mathematics%20(0580)/0580_s03_qp_1.pdf'
    r = requests.get(url)
    with open('0580_s03_qp_1.pdf', 'wb') as outfile:
        outfile.write(r.content)
