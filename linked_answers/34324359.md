Tested with Python 2.7 and 3.5, the following code should work as intended.

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # CommentedTreeBuilder.py
    from xml.etree import ElementTree
    
    class CommentedTreeBuilder(ElementTree.TreeBuilder):
        def comment(self, data):
            self.start(ElementTree.Comment, {})
            self.data(data)
            self.end(ElementTree.Comment)

Then, in the main code use 

    parser = ElementTree.XMLParser(target=CommentedTreeBuilder())

as the parser instead of the current one.

By the way, comments work correctly out of the box with `lxml`. That is, you can just do

    import lxml.etree as ET
    tree = ET.parse(filename)

without needing any of the above.
