In your `save` you have to have the argument `commit`. If anything overrides your form, or wants to modify what it's saving, it will do `save(commit=False)`, modify the output, and then save it itself.

Also, your ModelForm should return the model it's saving. Usually a ModelForm's `save` will look something like:

    def save(self, commit=True):
        m = super(CallResultTypeForm, self).save(commit=False)
        # do custom stuff
        if commit:
            m.save()
        return m

Read up on [the `save` method](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/modelforms/#the-save-method).

Finally, a lot of this ModelForm won't work just because of the way you are accessing things. Instead of `self.callResult`, you need to use `self.fields['callResult']`.

*UPDATE*: In response to your answer:

*Aside:* Why not just use `ManyToManyField`s in the Model so you don't have to do this? Seems like you're storing redundant data and making more work for yourself (and me `:P`).

    from django.db.models import AutoField  
    def copy_model_instance(obj):  
        """
        Create a copy of a model instance. 
        M2M relationships are currently not handled, i.e. they are not copied. (Fortunately, you don't have any in this case)
        See also Django #4027. From http://blog.elsdoerfer.name/2008/09/09/making-a-copy-of-a-model-instance/
        """  
        initial = dict([(f.name, getattr(obj, f.name)) for f in obj._meta.fields if not isinstance(f, AutoField) and not f in obj._meta.parents.values()])  
        return obj.__class__(**initial)  

    class CallResultTypeForm(ModelForm):
        callResult = ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=CallResult.objects.all())
        campaign = ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Campaign.objects.all())
        callType = ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=CallType.objects.all())
    
        def save(self, commit=True, *args, **kwargs):
            m = super(CallResultTypeForm, self).save(commit=False, *args, **kwargs)
            results = []
            for cr in self.callResult:
                for c in self.campain:
                    for ct in self.callType:
                        m_new = copy_model_instance(m)
                        m_new.callResult = cr
                        m_new.campaign = c
                        m_new.calltype = ct
                        if commit:
                            m_new.save()
                        results.append(m_new)
             return results

This allows for inheritance of `CallResultTypeForm`, just in case that's ever necessary.
