<p>The <code>webdriver</code> will wait for a page to load by default via <code>.get()</code> method.</p>

<p>As you may be looking for some specific element as @user227215 said, you should use <code>WebDriverWait</code> to wait for an element located in your page:</p>

<pre><code>from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException

browser = webdriver.Firefox()
browser.get("url")
delay = 3 # seconds
try:
    myElem = WebDriverWait(browser, delay).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, 'IdOfMyElement')))
    print "Page is ready!"
except TimeoutException:
    print "Loading took too much time!"
</code></pre>

<p>I have used it for checking alerts. You can use any other type methods to find the locator. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong></p>

<p>I should mention that the <code>webdriver</code> will wait for a page to load by default. It does not wait for loading inside frames or for ajax requests. It means when you use <code>.get('url')</code>, your browser will wait until the page is completely loaded and then go to the next command in the code. But when you are posting an ajax request, <code>webdriver</code> does not wait and it's your responsibility to wait an appropriate amount of time for the page or a part of page to load; so there is a module named <code>expected_conditions</code>.</p>
