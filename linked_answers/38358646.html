<p>You'd use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlretrieve" rel="noreferrer"><code>urllib.request.urlretrieve</code></a>.  Note that this function "may become deprecated at some point in the future", so you might be better off using the less likely to be deprecated interface:</p>

<pre><code># Adapted from the source:
# https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/urllib/request.py#l170
with open(filename, 'wb') as out_file:
    with contextlib.closing(urllib.request.urlopen(url)) as fp:
        block_size = 1024 * 8
        while True:
            block = fp.read(block_size)
            if not block:
                break
            out_file.write(block)
</code></pre>

<p>For small enough files, you could just <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> the whole thing and drop the loop entirely.</p>
