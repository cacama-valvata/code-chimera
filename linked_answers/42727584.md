Explanation
==

Note that the equation of a line is `ax+by+c=0`. So if a point is on this line, then it is a solution to `(a,b,c).(x,y,1)=0` (`.` is the dot product)

let `l1=(a1,b1,c1)`, `l2=(a2,b2,c2)` be two lines and `p1=(x1,y1,1)`, `p2=(x2,y2,1)` be two points.

Finding the line passing through two points:
--

let `t=p1xp2` (the cross product of two points) be a vector representing a line.

We know that `p1` is on the line `t` because `t.p1 = (p1xp2).p1=0`.
We also know that `p2` is on `t` because `t.p2 = (p1xp2).p2=0`. So `t` must be the line passing through `p1` and `p2`. 

This means that *we can get the vector representation of a line by taking the cross product of two points on that line*.

Finding the point of intersection:
----

Now let `r=l1xl2` (the cross product of two lines) be a vector representing a point

We know `r` lies on `l1` because `r.l1=(l1xl2).l1=0`. We also know `r` lies on `l2` because `r.l2=(l1xl2).l2=0`. So `r` must be the point of intersection of the lines `l1` and `l2`. 

Interestingly, *we can find the point of intersection by taking the cross product of two lines*.
