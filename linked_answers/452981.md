Reflection in python is a lot easier and far more flexible than it is in Java.

I recommend reading this [tutorial](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105303/http://www.diveintopython.net/power_of_introspection/index.html) (on archive.org)

There's no direct function (that I know of) which takes a fully qualified class name and returns the class, however you have all the pieces needed to build that, and you can connect them together.

One bit of advice though: don't try to program in Java style when you're in python.

If you can explain what is it that you're trying to do, maybe we can help you find a more pythonic way of doing it.

Here's a function that does what you want:

    def get_class( kls ):
        parts = kls.split('.')
        module = ".".join(parts[:-1])
        m = __import__( module )
        for comp in parts[1:]:
            m = getattr(m, comp)            
        return m


You can use the return value of this function as if it were the class itself.

Here's a usage example:

    >>> D = get_class("datetime.datetime")
    >>> D
    <type 'datetime.datetime'>
    >>> D.now()
    datetime.datetime(2009, 1, 17, 2, 15, 58, 883000)
    >>> a = D( 2010, 4, 22 )
    >>> a
    datetime.datetime(2010, 4, 22, 0, 0)
    >>> 

**How does that work?**

We're using `__import__` to import the module that holds the class, which required that we first extract the module name from the fully qualified name. Then we import the module:
    
    m = __import__( module )

In this case, `m` will only refer to the top level module, 

For example, if your class lives in `foo.baz` module, then `m` will be the module `foo`  
We can easily obtain a reference to `foo.baz` using `getattr( m, 'baz' )`

To get from the top level module to the class, have to recursively use `gettatr` on the parts of the class name

Say for example, if you class name is `foo.baz.bar.Model` then we do this:

    m = __import__( "foo.baz.bar" ) #m is package foo
    m = getattr( m, "baz" ) #m is package baz
    m = getattr( m, "bar" ) #m is module bar
    m = getattr( m, "Model" ) #m is class Model
    

This is what's happening in this loop:

    for comp in parts[1:]:
        m = getattr(m, comp)    

At the end of the loop, `m` will be a reference to the class. This means that `m` is actually the class itslef, you can do for instance:

    a = m() #instantiate a new instance of the class    
    b = m( arg1, arg2 ) # pass arguments to the constructor
