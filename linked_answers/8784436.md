Use [regular expressions][1]:

    >>> import re
    >>> s = '<@ """@$ FSDF >something something <more noise>'
    >>> re.sub('<[^>]+>', '', s)
    'something something '

[Update]

If you tried a pattern like `<.+>`, where the dot means any character and the plus sign means one or more, you know it does not work.

    >>> re.sub(r'<.+>', s, '')
    ''

Why!?! It happens because regular expressions are "greedy" by default. The expression will match anything until the end of the string, including the `>` - and this is not what we want. We want to match `<` and stop on the next `>`, so we use the `[^x]` pattern which means "any character but x" (x being `>`). 

The `?` operator turns the match "non-greedy", so this has the same effect:

    >>> re.sub(r'<.+?>', '', s)
    'something something '

The previous is more explicit, this one is less typing; be aware that `x?` means zero or one occurrence of x.
