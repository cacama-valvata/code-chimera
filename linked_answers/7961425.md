**In Python 2.7**, the new way of removing duplicates from an iterable while keeping it in the original order is:

    >>> from collections import OrderedDict
    >>> list(OrderedDict.fromkeys('abracadabra'))
    ['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd']

**In Python 3.5**, the OrderedDict has a C implementation. My timings show that this is now both the fastest and shortest of the various approaches for Python 3.5.

**In Python 3.6**, the regular dict became both ordered and compact.  (This feature is holds for CPython and PyPy but may not present in other implementations).  That gives us a new fastest way of deduping while retaining order:

    >>> list(dict.fromkeys('abracadabra'))
    ['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd']

**In Python 3.7**, the regular dict is guaranteed to both ordered across all implementations.  **So, the shortest and fastest solution is:**

    >>> list(dict.fromkeys('abracadabra'))
    ['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd']
