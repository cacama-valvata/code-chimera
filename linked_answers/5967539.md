Perhaps you are looking for [human sorting][1] (also known as [natural sorting][2]):

    import re
        
    def atoi(text):
        return int(text) if text.isdigit() else text
    
    def natural_keys(text):
        '''
        alist.sort(key=natural_keys) sorts in human order
        http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200712/human_sorting.html
        (See Toothy's implementation in the comments)
        '''
        return [ atoi(c) for c in re.split(r'(\d+)', text) ]

    alist=[
        "something1",
        "something12",
        "something17",
        "something2",
        "something25",
        "something29"]
    
    alist.sort(key=natural_keys)
    print(alist)

yields
    
    ['something1', 'something2', 'something12', 'something17', 'something25', 'something29']

PS. I've changed my answer to use Toothy's implementation of natural sorting (posted in the comments [here][3]) since it is significantly faster than my original answer.


----------

If you wish to sort text with floats, then you'll need to change the regex from one that matches ints (i.e. `(\d+)`) to [a regex that matches floats](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12643073/190597):

    import re

    def atof(text):
        try:
            retval = float(text)
        except ValueError:
            retval = text
        return retval

    def natural_keys(text):
        '''
        alist.sort(key=natural_keys) sorts in human order
        http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200712/human_sorting.html
        (See Toothy's implementation in the comments)
        float regex comes from https://stackoverflow.com/a/12643073/190597
        '''
        return [ atof(c) for c in re.split(r'[+-]?([0-9]+(?:[.][0-9]*)?|[.][0-9]+)', text) ]

    alist=[
        "something1",
        "something2",
        "something1.0",
        "something1.25",
        "something1.105"]

    alist.sort(key=natural_keys)
    print(alist)

yields

    ['something1', 'something1.0', 'something1.105', 'something1.25', 'something2']
