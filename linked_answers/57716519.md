On Windows (might work but untested on Linux):

    import sys
    import os

    # e.g. c:\Users\dogbert\Anaconda3\envs\myenvironment
    print( sys.exec_prefix.split(os.sep)[-1] )

Answers using environment variables or assuming the path separator is "/" didn't work in my Windows/Anaconda3 environment.

This assumes you are in an environment.
