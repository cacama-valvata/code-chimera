It seems more pythonic to use a `for` loop. 
See the quote from [Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.0](https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#builtins).
> Removed `reduce()`. Use `functools.reduce()` if you really need it; however, 99 percent of the time an explicit `for` loop is more readable.

    def nested_get(dic, keys):    
        for key in keys:
            dic = dic[key]
        return dic

    def nested_set(dic, keys, value):
        for key in keys[:-1]:
            dic = dic.setdefault(key, {})
        dic[keys[-1]] = value

    def nested_del(dic, keys):
        for key in keys[:-1]:
            dic = dic[key]
        del dic[keys[-1]]

Note that the accepted solution doesn't set non-existing nested keys (it raises `KeyError`). Using the approach above will create non-existing nodes instead.

The code works in both Python 2 and 3.
