*After some work I am able to respond to my own question. Below, I make my own interpretations/analysis, but perhaps misunderstand what actually happens in some steps. Nevertheless, below works as intended and is a complete answer to the question.*

#     1. Given no native (model) support for BinaryField within DRF, first step is to construct your own field:

    class MyBinaryField(serializers.Field):
        def to_internal_value(self, obj):
            return base64.b64decode(obj)
    '''
    to_internal_value is obj to database and it seems DRF 
    sees the POST as a string (despite being encoded as bytes, 
    therefore, by decode the string, you get to 
    the underlying bytes data (pickle.dumps).   
    '''
    
        def to_representation(self, value):
            return base64.b64encode(value)
    
    '''
    to_representation is the visual feedback, and in order 
    for being able to see the byte data one need to decode it.   
    '''

# 2. Once you got your new Field, you implement it into a Serializer, 
# and define methods.
# Please note that `serializers.ModelSerializer` wont work, 
# so you need to use `serializers.Serializer`


    class DataFrameSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
        serializer_field_mapping = (
            serializers.ModelSerializer.serializer_field_mapping.copy()
        )
        serializer_field_mapping[models.BinaryField] = MyBinaryField

        df_object = MyBinaryField()

        def create(self, validated_data):
            """
            Create and return a new `DataFrame' instance, given the validated data.
            """
            return DataFrame.objects.create(**validated_data)

        def update(self, instance, validated_data):
            """
            Update and return an existing 'DataFrame' instance, given the validated data.
            """
            instance.df_object = validated_data.get('df_object', instance.df_object)
            instance.save()
            return instance
    
    
# 3. Finally, you define your view

    class DataFrameView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        queryset = DataFrame.objects.all()
        serializer_class = DataFrameSerializer
    
    
    
# 4. Then, you can access and POST data through the API

    import pickle
    import requests
    import base64
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [0, 1, 2, 3]})
    pickbytes = pickle.dumps(df)
    b64_pickbytes = base64.b64encode(pickbytes)

    url = 'http://localhost:8000/api/DataFrame/'
    payload = {'df_object':b64_pickbytes}
    r = requests.post(url=url, data=payload)

# 5. To retreive the data and re-create the DataFrame

     >>> new = DataFrame.objects.first()
     >>> byt = new.df_object
     >>> s = pickle.loads(byt)
     >>> s
        a
     0  0
     1  1
     2  2
     3  3
