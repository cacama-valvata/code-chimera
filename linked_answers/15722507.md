    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: a = np.array([[00,01], [10,11], [20,21], [30,31], [40,41], [50,51]])

    In [3]: w = np.hstack((a[:-2],a[1:-1],a[2:]))

    In [4]: w
    Out[4]: 
    array([[ 0,  1, 10, 11, 20, 21],
           [10, 11, 20, 21, 30, 31],
           [20, 21, 30, 31, 40, 41],
           [30, 31, 40, 41, 50, 51]])

You could write this in as a function as so:

    def window_stack(a, stepsize=1, width=3):
        n = a.shape[0]
        return np.hstack( a[i:1+n+i-width:stepsize] for i in range(0,width) )

------
This doesn't really depend on the shape of the original array, as long as `a.ndim = 2`.  Note that I never use either lengths in the interactive version.  The second dimension of the shape is irrelevant; each row can be as long as you want.   Thanks to @Jaime's suggestion, you can do it without checking the shape at all:

    def window_stack(a, stepsize=1, width=3):
        return np.hstack( a[i:1+i-width or None:stepsize] for i in range(0,width) )
