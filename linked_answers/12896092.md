My solution for the question:

Define a `MemoryHandler` to handle all the events prior to the definition of the `FileHandler`.  
When the `FileHandler` is defined, set it as the flush target of the `MemoryHandler` and flush it.  

    import logging
    import logging.handlers
    #create a logger object:
    logger = logging.getLogger("MyLogger")
    #define a memory handler:
    memHandler = logging.handlers.MemoryHandler(capacity = 1024*10)
    logger.addHandler(memHandler)
    #...
    #initialization code with several logging events (for example, loading a configuration file to a 'conf' object)
    #everything is logged by the memory handler
    #...

    #after configuration is loaded, a new logging handler is defined for a log file:
    fileHandler = logging.FileHandler(conf.get("main","log_file"),'w')
    #flush the memory handler into the new file handler:
    memHandler.setTarget(fileHandler)
    memHandler.flush()
    memHandler.close()
    logger.removeHandler(memHandler)
    logger.addHandler(fileHandler)


This works for me, so I'm accepting this as the correct answer, until a more elegant answer comes along.
