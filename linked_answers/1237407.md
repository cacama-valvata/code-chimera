Here's what you need

Three ways, the first is simple but crude ([Thomas Heller][1]) - add the following to site-packages/sitecustomize.py:
    

    import pdb, sys, traceback
    def info(type, value, tb):
        traceback.print_exception(type, value, tb)
        pdb.pm()
    sys.excepthook = info

The second is more sophisticated, and checks for interactive mode (weirdly skipping the debugging in interactive mode), from the [cookbook][2]:
    
    # code snippet, to be included in 'sitecustomize.py'
    import sys
    
    def info(type, value, tb):
       if hasattr(sys, 'ps1') or not sys.stderr.isatty():
          # we are in interactive mode or we don't have a tty-like
          # device, so we call the default hook
          sys.__excepthook__(type, value, tb)
       else:
          import traceback, pdb
          # we are NOT in interactive mode, print the exception...
          traceback.print_exception(type, value, tb)
          print
          # ...then start the debugger in post-mortem mode.
          pdb.pm()
    
    sys.excepthook = info

And the third (which always start the debugger unless stdin or stderr are redirected) by [ynniv][3]

    # code snippet, to be included in 'sitecustomize.py'
    import sys
    
    def info(type, value, tb):
       if (#hasattr(sys, "ps1") or
           not sys.stderr.isatty() or 
           not sys.stdin.isatty()):
           # stdin or stderr is redirected, just do the normal thing
           original_hook(type, value, tb)
       else:
           # a terminal is attached and stderr is not redirected, debug 
           import traceback, pdb
           traceback.print_exception(type, value, tb)
           print
           pdb.pm()
           #traceback.print_stack()
    
    original_hook = sys.excepthook
    if sys.excepthook == sys.__excepthook__:
        # if someone already patched excepthook, let them win
        sys.excepthook = info
