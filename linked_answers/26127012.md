[The Fibonacci sphere algorithm][1] is great for this. It is fast and gives results that at a glance will easily fool the human eye. [You can see an example done with processing][2] which will show the result over time as points are added. [Here's another great interactive example][3] made by @gman. And here's a simple implementation in python.

    import math
    
    
    def fibonacci_sphere(samples=1000):
    
        points = []
        phi = math.pi * (math.sqrt(5.) - 1.)  # golden angle in radians
    
        for i in range(samples):
            y = 1 - (i / float(samples - 1)) * 2  # y goes from 1 to -1
            radius = math.sqrt(1 - y * y)  # radius at y
    
            theta = phi * i  # golden angle increment
    
            x = math.cos(theta) * radius
            z = math.sin(theta) * radius
    
            points.append((x, y, z))
    
        return points


1000 samples gives you this:
