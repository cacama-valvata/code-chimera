You can use `return` once in a generator; it stops iteration without yielding anything, and thus provides an explicit alternative to letting the function run out of scope. So use `yield` to turn the function into a generator, but precede it with `return` to terminate the generator before yielding anything.

    >>> def f():
    ...     return
    ...     yield
    ... 
    >>> list(f())
    []

I'm not sure it's that much better than what you have -- it just replaces a no-op `if` statement with a no-op `yield` statement. But it is more idiomatic. Note that just using `yield` doesn't work.

    >>> def f():
    ...     yield
    ... 
    >>> list(f())
    [None]

### Why not just use `iter(())`?

This question asks specifically about an empty *generator function*. For that reason, I take it to be a question about the internal consistency of Python's syntax, rather than a question about the best way to create an empty iterator in general.

If question is actually about the best way to create an empty iterator, then you might agree with [Zectbumo](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26271684/577088) about using `iter(())` instead. However, it's important to observe that `iter(())` doesn't return a function! It directly returns an empty iterable. Suppose you're working with an API that expects a callable that *returns* an iterable each time it's called, just like an ordinary generator function. You'll have to do something like this:

    def empty():
        return iter(())

(Credit should go to [Unutbu](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13243922/577088) for giving the first correct version of this answer.)

Now, you may find the above clearer, but I can imagine situations in which it would be less clear. Consider this example of a long list of (contrived) generator function definitions:

    def zeros():
        while True:
            yield 0

    def ones():
        while True:
            yield 1

    ...

At the end of that long list, I'd rather see something with a `yield` in it, like this:

    def empty():
        return
        yield

or, in Python 3.3 and above (as suggested by [DSM](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13243920/577088)), this:

    def empty():
        yield from ()

The presence of the `yield` keyword makes it clear at the briefest glance that this is just another generator function, exactly like all the others. It takes a bit more time to see that the `iter(())` version is doing the same thing.

It's a subtle difference, but I honestly think the `yield`-based functions are more readable and maintainable.

See also this great answer from [user3840170](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61496399/577088) that uses `dis` to show another reason why this approach is preferable: it emits the fewest instructions when compiled.
