You can avoid a useless use of `cat` and handle mismatched quotes better with this:

    $ read -r -d '' VAR <<'EOF'
    abc'asdf"
    $(dont-execute-this)
    foo"bar"''
    EOF

If you don't quote the variable when you echo it, newlines are lost. Quoting it preserves them:

    $ echo "$VAR"
    abc'asdf"
    $(dont-execute-this)
    foo"bar"''

If you want to use indentation for readability in the source code, use a dash after the less-thans. The indentation must be done using only tabs (no spaces).

    $ read -r -d '' VAR <<-'EOF'
        abc'asdf"
        $(dont-execute-this)
        foo"bar"''
        EOF
    $ echo "$VAR"
    abc'asdf"
    $(dont-execute-this)
    foo"bar"''

If, instead, you want to preserve the tabs in the contents of the resulting variable, you need to remove tab from `IFS`. The terminal marker for the here doc (`EOF`) must not be indented.

    $ IFS='' read -r -d '' VAR <<'EOF'
        abc'asdf"
        $(dont-execute-this)
        foo"bar"''
    EOF
    $ echo "$VAR"
        abc'asdf"
        $(dont-execute-this)
        foo"bar"''

Tabs can be inserted at the command line by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>V</kbd> <kbd>Tab</kbd>. If you are using an editor, depending on which one, that may also work or you may have to turn off the feature that automatically converts tabs to spaces.


In `read -r -d ''`, the options are:

- `-r` to accept backslashes literally instead of using them to escape any characters
- `-d` sets the first character of the following argument as the delimiter between records (lines), instead of the default which is newline. In the example, I'm setting the delimiter to a null string, so that the whole string passed to `read` will be read as one record.
