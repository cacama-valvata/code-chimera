The answer is no, but as of Python 3.7 you can use the simple `dict` from the Python standard library with just keys (and values as `None`) for the same purpose.

Here's an example of how to use `dict` as an ordered set to filter out duplicate items while preserving order, thereby emulating an ordered set. Use the `dict` class method `fromkeys()` to create a dict, then simply ask for the `keys()` back.

    >>> keywords = ['foo', 'bar', 'bar', 'foo', 'baz', 'foo']

    >>> list(dict.fromkeys(keywords))
    ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']

For older versions of Python, use the [`collections.OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
