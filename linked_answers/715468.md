    def str2bool(v):
      return v.lower() in ("yes", "true", "t", "1")

Then call it like so:

```python
>>> str2bool("yes")
True
>>> str2bool("no")
False
>>> str2bool("stuff")
False
>>> str2bool("1")
True
>>> str2bool("0")
False
```

**Handling true and false explicitly:**

You could also make your function explicitly check against a True list of words and a False list of words.  Then if it is in neither list, you could throw an exception.
