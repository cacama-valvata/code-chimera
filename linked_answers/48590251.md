In addition to [`git describe`, that I mention in my previous answer][1], `git log` and `git diff` now benefits as well from the "`--find-object=<object-id>`" option to limit the findings to changes that involve the named object.  
That is in Git 2.16.x/2.17 (Q1 2018)

See [commit 4d8c51a](https://github.com/git/git/commit/4d8c51aa19be94bddb7cac6b11bccb4d23dfd4f8), [commit 5e50525](https://github.com/git/git/commit/5e505257f2651647c072f9c61fdc5dd52bbce8b2), [commit 15af58c](https://github.com/git/git/commit/15af58c1adba431c216e2a45fa0d22944560ba02), [commit cf63051](https://github.com/git/git/commit/cf63051adad03e827e0313a57db0a79ad39a04a0), [commit c1ddc46](https://github.com/git/git/commit/c1ddc4610c553b06591aac74b610b56448cbb976), [commit 929ed70](https://github.com/git/git/commit/929ed70a7263fc3be909b363993672b649153706) (04 Jan 2018) by [Stefan Beller (`stefanbeller`)](https://github.com/stefanbeller).

> ## `diffcore`: add a pickaxe option to find a specific blob

> Sometimes users are given a hash of an object and they want to identify it further (ex.: Use `verify-pack` to find the largest blobs, but what are these? Or this Stack Overflow question "[Which commit has this blob?][2]")
>
> One might be tempted to extend `git-describe` to also work with blobs, such that `git describe <blob-id>` gives a description as
'`<commit-ish>:<path>`'.  
This was [implemented here][3]; as seen by the sheer
number of responses (>110), it turns out this is tricky to get right.  
The hard part to get right is picking the correct 'commit-ish' as that could be the commit that (re-)introduced the blob or the blob that
removed the blob; the blob could exist in different branches.

Teach the `diff` machinery another flag for restricting the information to what is shown.  
For example:
>
>     $ ./git log --oneline --find-object=v2.0.0:Makefile
>       b2feb64 Revert the whole "ask curl-config" topic for now
>       47fbfde i18n: only extract comments marked with "TRANSLATORS:"
>
> we observe that the `Makefile` as shipped with `2.0` was appeared in
`v1.9.2-471-g47fbfded53` and in `v2.0.0-rc1-5-gb2feb6430b`.  
The reason these commits both occurred before v2.0.0 are evil-merges that are not found using this new mechanism.

As noted in [the comments][4] by [marcono1234][5], you can combine that with the [git log --all][6] option:

> this can be useful when you don't know which branch contains the object.

> It was reported that git-verify-pack(1) has started to crash with Git v2.46.0 when run outside of a repository.  
> This is another fallout from [c8aed5e](https://github.com/git/git/commit/c8aed5e8dadf913e041cde72d704aa91f378b71b) ("`repository`: stop setting SHA1 as the default object hash", 2024-05-07, Git v2.46.0-rc0 -- [merge](https://github.com/git/git/commit/a60c21b7206fff1a6ab561e29ac7312c437d2592) listed in [batch #9](https://github.com/git/git/commit/58bac47f8eb2c5e92e354f33ee079a244e5b5003)), where we have stopped setting the default hash algorithm for `the_repository`.  
> Consequently, code that relies on `the_hash_algo` will now crash when it hasn't explicitly been initialized, which may be the case when running outside of a Git repository.

> The crash is not in `git-verify-pack(1)` but instead in `git-index-pack(1)`, which gets called by the former.  
> Ideally, both of these programs should be able to identify the hash algorithm used by the packfile and index without having to rely on external information.  
> But unfortunately, the format for neither of them is completely self-describing, so it is not possible to derive that information.  
> This is a design issue that we should address by introducing a new packfile version that encodes its object hash.  
>
> For now though the more important fix is to not make either of these programs crash anymore, which we do by falling back to SHA1 when the object hash is unconfigured.  
> This pessimizes reading packfiles which use a different hash than SHA1, but restores previous behaviour.
