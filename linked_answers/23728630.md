This Stack Overflow quesion is the current top Google result for "random string Python". The current top answer is:

    ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for _ in range(N))

This is an excellent method, but the [PRNG][1] in random is not cryptographically secure. I assume many people researching this question will want to generate random strings for encryption or passwords. You can do this securely by making a small change in the above code:

    ''.join(random.SystemRandom().choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for _ in range(N))

Using `random.SystemRandom()` instead of just random uses /dev/urandom on *nix machines and `CryptGenRandom()` in Windows.  These are cryptographically secure PRNGs. Using `random.choice` instead of `random.SystemRandom().choice` in an application that requires a secure PRNG could be potentially devastating, and given the popularity of this question, I bet that mistake has been made many times already.

If you're using python3.6 or above, you can use the new [secrets][2] module as mentioned in [MSeifert's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41464693/7851470):

    ''.join(secrets.choice(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits) for _ in range(N))

The module docs also discuss convenient ways to [generate secure tokens][3] and [best practices][4].
