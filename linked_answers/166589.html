<p>I just found this but it seems a bit hackish, however they say tried it on *nix and I did on windows and it worked.</p>

<pre><code>import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.connect(("8.8.8.8", 80))
print(s.getsockname()[0])
s.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you have an internet access, and that there is no local proxy.</p>
