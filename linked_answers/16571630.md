Try this context manager:

    from io import StringIO 
    import sys
    
    class Capturing(list):
        def __enter__(self):
            self._stdout = sys.stdout
            sys.stdout = self._stringio = StringIO()
            return self
        def __exit__(self, *args):
            self.extend(self._stringio.getvalue().splitlines())
            del self._stringio    # free up some memory
            sys.stdout = self._stdout

Usage:

    with Capturing() as output:
        do_something(my_object)

`output` is now a list containing the lines printed by the function call.

Advanced usage:

What may not be obvious is that this can be done more than once and the results concatenated:

    with Capturing() as output:
        print('hello world')
    
    print('displays on screen')
    
    with Capturing(output) as output:  # note the constructor argument
        print('hello world2')
    
    print('done')
    print('output:', output)

Output:

<!-- language: lang-none -->

    displays on screen                     
    done                                   
    output: ['hello world', 'hello world2']

*Update*: They added `redirect_stdout()` to [`contextlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.redirect_stdout) in Python 3.4 (along with `redirect_stderr()`). So you could use `io.StringIO` with that to achieve a similar result (though `Capturing` being a list as well as a context manager is arguably more convenient).
