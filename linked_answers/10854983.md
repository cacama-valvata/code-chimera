Gives a UTC offset like in ThomasH's answer, but takes daylight savings into account.

    >>> import time
    >>> offset = time.timezone if (time.localtime().tm_isdst == 0) else time.altzone
    >>> offset / 60 / 60 * -1
    -9

The value of `time.timezone` or `time.altzone` is in seconds West of UTC (with areas East of UTC getting a negative value). This is the opposite to how we'd actually like it, hence the * -1.

`time.localtime().tm_isdst` will be zero if daylight savings is currently not in effect (although this may not be correct if an area has recently changed their daylight savings law).

EDIT: marr75 is correct, I've edited the answer accordingly.
