My original answer is below.

Eric S.'s answer is excellent, but I learned by experimentation that this will always cause messages logged at the new debug level to be printed -- regardless of what the log level is set to. So if you make a new level number of `9`, if you call `setLevel(50)`, the **lower level** messages will erroneously be printed. 
> To prevent that from happening, you need another line inside the "debugv" function to check if the logging level in question is actually enabled.

Fixed example that checks if the logging level is enabled:

    import logging
    DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM = 9 
    logging.addLevelName(DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM, "DEBUGV")
    def debugv(self, message, *args, **kws):
        if self.isEnabledFor(DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM):
            # Yes, logger takes its '*args' as 'args'.
            self._log(DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM, message, args, **kws) 
    logging.Logger.debugv = debugv


If you look at the code for `class Logger` in `logging.__init__.py` for Python 2.7, this is what all the standard log functions do (.critical, .debug, etc.).

I apparently can't post replies to others' answers for lack of reputation... hopefully Eric will update his post if he sees this. =)
