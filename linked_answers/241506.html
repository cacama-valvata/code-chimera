<p>This handles C++-style comments, C-style comments, strings and simple nesting thereof.</p>

<pre><code>def comment_remover(text):
    def replacer(match):
        s = match.group(0)
        if s.startswith('/'):
            return " " # note: a space and not an empty string
        else:
            return s
    pattern = re.compile(
        r'//.*?$|/\*.*?\*/|\'(?:\\.|[^\\\'])*\'|"(?:\\.|[^\\"])*"',
        re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE
    )
    return re.sub(pattern, replacer, text)
</code></pre>

<p>Strings needs to be included, because comment-markers inside them does not start a comment.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> re.sub didn't take any flags, so had to compile the pattern first.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Added character literals, since they could contain quotes that would otherwise be recognized as string delimiters.</p>

<p><strong>Edit3:</strong> Fixed the case where a legal expression <code>int/**/x=5;</code> would become <code>intx=5;</code> which would not compile, by replacing the comment with a space rather then an empty string.</p>
