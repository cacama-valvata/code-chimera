The else clause is only executed when the *while-condition* becomes false.

Here are some examples:

**Example 1:** Initially the condition is false, so *else-clause* is executed.

    i = 99999999
    
    while i < 5:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    else:
        print('this')
OUTPUT:

    this

**Example 2:** The *while-condition* `i < 5` never became false because `i == 3` breaks the loop, so *else-clause* was not executed.

    i = 0
    
    while i < 5:
        print(i)
        if i == 3:
            break
        i += 1
    else:
        print('this')
OUTPUT:

    0
    1
    2
    3

**Example 3:** The *while-condition* `i < 5` became  false when `i` was `5`, so *else-clause* was executed.

    i = 0
    
    while i < 5:
        print(i)
        i += 1
    else:
        print('this')

OUTPUT:

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    this
