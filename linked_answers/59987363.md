This:

    def __post_init__(self):
        super(NamedObj, self).__post_init__()
        super(NumberedObj, self).__post_init__()
        print("NamedAndNumbered __post_init__")


doesn't do what you think it does. `super(cls, obj)` will return a proxy to the class __after__ `cls` in `type(obj).__mro__` - so, in your case, to `object`. And the whole point of cooperative `super()` calls is to avoid having to explicitely call each of the parents.

The way cooperative `super()` calls are intended to work is, well, by being "cooperative" - IOW, everyone in the mro is supposed to relay the call to the next class (actually, the `super` name is a rather sad choice, as it's not about calling "the super class", but about "calling the next class in the mro"). 

IOW, you want each of your "composable" dataclasses (which are not mixins - mixins only have behaviour) to relay the call, so you can compose them in any order. A first naive implementation would look like:

    @dataclass
    class NamedObj:
        name: str
    
        def __post_init__(self):
            super().__post_init__()
            print("NamedObj __post_init__")
            self.name = "Name: " + self.name
    
    @dataclass
    class NumberedObj:
        number: int = 0
    
        def __post_init__(self):
            super().__post_init__()
            print("NumberedObj __post_init__")
            self.number += 1
    
    @dataclass
    class NamedAndNumbered(NumberedObj, NamedObj):
    
        def __post_init__(self):
            super().__post_init__()
            print("NamedAndNumbered __post_init__")

 
BUT this doesn't work, since for the last class in the mro (here `NamedObj`), the next class in the mro is the builtin `object` class, which doesn't have a `__post_init__` method. The solution is simple: just add a base class that defines this method as a noop, and make all your composable dataclasses inherit from it:

    class Base(object):
        def __post_init__(self):
            # just intercept the __post_init__ calls so they
            # aren't relayed to `object`
            pass
    
    @dataclass
    class NamedObj(Base):
        name: str
    
        def __post_init__(self):
            super().__post_init__()
            print("NamedObj __post_init__")
            self.name = "Name: " + self.name
    
    @dataclass
    class NumberedObj(Base):
        number: int = 0
    
        def __post_init__(self):
            super().__post_init__()
            print("NumberedObj __post_init__")
            self.number += 1
    
    @dataclass
    class NamedAndNumbered(NumberedObj, NamedObj):
    
        def __post_init__(self):
            super().__post_init__()
            print("NamedAndNumbered __post_init__")
