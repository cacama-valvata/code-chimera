You could use the `struct` module to pack the floating-point value into a buffer.  The `"d"` [format string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#format-characters) gives an 8-byte `double`.

```
import struct

x = float(0.1)
buf = struct.pack("d", x)
print(buf)  # b'\x9a\x99\x99\x99\x99\x99\xb9?'

# Hex dump, for readability
print(" ".join("{:02X}".format(b) for b in buf))  # 9A 99 99 99 99 99 B9 3F
```

The buffer will reflect the native endianness of your system.  You can also experiment with [byte-order specifiers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html#byte-order-size-and-alignment) in the format string.

You can also re-interpret the same bytes as an integer.  To do this, you can use the unsigned integer type of the same size (8 bytes).  In this case, it would be the `long long` unsigned integer (format string `"Q"`):
```
# Interpret bytes as unsigned integer.
i, = struct.unpack("Q", buf)
print("{:0>16X}".format(i))  # 3FB999999999999A
```

Finally, if you want, you can interpret the buffer as a `double`, and confirm that the value survives a round-trip serialization:
```
x2, = struct.unpack("d", buf)
print(x2)       # 0.1
print(x2 == x)  # True
```

## Viewing floating-point representation components

To view the individual components of the floating point number, you can examine parts of the integer equivalent using bitmasks.

```
import struct

x = -(16 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0.5)
buf = struct.pack("d", x)
i, = struct.unpack("Q", buf)
```

Here, `x` has a value of `-0b10111.1`, or equivalently `-0b1.01111 * 2^4`.

There are two important notes about the [IEEE 753 representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754):
* the exponent has a *bias* of 1023, so we expect a value of 1027 stored in the exponent.
* the mantissaâ€™s leading `1` is implicit, so we expect the mantissa bits to be `01111`.

We can use the appropriate masks for the bit patterns shown in the question, then print in binary 

```
print(format(i, '0>64b'))

SIGN_MASK = 0x8000000000000000
EXPN_MASK = 0x7FF0000000000000
MANT_MASK = 0x000FFFFFFFFFFFFF
print(format(i & SIGN_MASK, '0>1b')[:1])
print(format(i & EXPN_MASK, '0>11b')[:11])
print(format(i & MANT_MASK, '0>52b'))
```

Results:
```
1100000000110111100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
