Both `getsize()` and `stat()` will throw an exception if the file does not exist. This function will return True/False - usually without throwing:
    
    import os
    def is_non_zero_file(fpath):  
        return os.path.isfile(fpath) and os.path.getsize(fpath) > 0


There is a race condition because the file may be removed between the calls to os.path.isfile(fpath) and os.path.getsize(fpath), in which case the proposed function will still raise an exception
