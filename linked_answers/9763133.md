It [already exists](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval)!

    >>> from ast import literal_eval as make_tuple
    >>> make_tuple("(1,2,3,4,5)")
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Be aware of the corner-case, though:

    >>> make_tuple("(1)")
    1
    >>> make_tuple("(1,)")
    (1,)

If your input format works different than Python here, you need to handle that case separately or use another method like `tuple(int(x) for x in tup_string[1:-1].split(','))`.
