**Update as of 19-02-2023**

The update to the below script is now alive as a Python package by the same author. You can install it from PyPi, which lives at https://pypi.org/project/pyuac/, and the source code/home page is located at https://github.com/Preston-Landers/pyuac. Install it using:

```
pip install pyuac
pip install pypiwin32
```

Direct usage of the package is:

```python
import pyuac

def main():
    print("Do stuff here that requires being run as an admin.")
    # The window will disappear as soon as the program exits!
    input("Press enter to close the window. >")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if not pyuac.isUserAdmin():
        print("Re-launching as admin!")
        pyuac.runAsAdmin()
    else:        
        main()  # Already an admin here.
```

Or, if you wish to use the decorator:

```python
from pyuac import main_requires_admin

@main_requires_admin
def main():
    print("Do stuff here that requires being run as an admin.")
    # The window will disappear as soon as the program exits!
    input("Press enter to close the window. >")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Original answer**

Thank you all for your reply. I got my script working with the module/script written by Preston Landers in 2010. After two days of browsing the internet, I could find the script. It was deeply hidden in the pywin32 mailing list. With this script, it is easier to check if the user is an admin, and if not, ask for UAC/admin privileges. It provides output in separate windows to display what the code is doing. An example of how to use the code is also included in the script. For the benefit of everyone who's looking for UAC on Windows, take a look at this code. It can be used something like this from your main script:-

```python
import admin

if not admin.isUserAdmin():
    admin.runAsAdmin()
```

The actual code (in the module) is:-

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8; mode: python; py-indent-offset: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil -*-
# vim: fileencoding=utf-8 tabstop=4 expandtab shiftwidth=4
