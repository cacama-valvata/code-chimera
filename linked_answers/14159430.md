I realize that this is an old question, but for people finding their way here via Google:  `package_data` is a low-down, [dirty lie][].  It is only used when building *binary* packages (`python setup.py bdist ...`) but *not* when building source packages (`python setup.py sdist ...`).  This is, of course, ridiculous -- one would expect that building a source distribution would result in a collection of files that could be sent to someone else to built the binary distribution.

In any case, using [`MANIFEST.in`][1] will work *both* for binary and for source distributions.
