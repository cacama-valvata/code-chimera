**Edit (April 2020)**: It seems that launcher script creation is now managed in Toolbox App settings.
See the [Toolbox App announcement][1] for more details.

--

1. Open Application Pycharm
2. Find tools in menu bar
3. Click `Create Command-line Launcher`
4. Checking the launcher executable file which has been created in `/usr/local/bin/charm`
5. Open project or file just type `$ charm YOUR_FOLDER_OR_FILE`

Maybe this is what you need.
