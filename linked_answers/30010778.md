I have encountered what might be the same problem before when I needed to run a Kalman filter for long periods but over time my covariance matrix would degenerate.  It might just be a problem of losing symmetry due to numerical error. One simple way to enforce your covariance matrix (let's call it `P`) to remain symmetric is to do:

    P = (P + P')/2  # where P' is transpose(P)

right after estimating `P`.
