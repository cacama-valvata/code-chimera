It's quite common to have a layout like this...

    main.py
    mypackage/
        __init__.py
        mymodule.py
        myothermodule.py

...with a `mymodule.py` like this...

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    # Exported function
    def as_int(a):
        return int(a)
    
    # Test function for module  
    def _test():
        assert as_int('1') == 1
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        _test()

...a `myothermodule.py` like this...

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from .mymodule import as_int

    # Exported function
    def add(a, b):
        return as_int(a) + as_int(b)
    
    # Test function for module  
    def _test():
        assert add('1', '1') == 2
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        _test()

...and a `main.py` like this...

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from mypackage.myothermodule import add
    
    def main():
        print(add('1', '1'))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

...which works fine when you run `main.py` or `mypackage/mymodule.py`, but fails with `mypackage/myothermodule.py`, due to the relative import...

    from .mymodule import as_int

The way you're supposed to run it is by using the -m option and giving the path in the Python module system (rather than in the filesystem)...

    python3 -m mypackage.myothermodule

...but it's somewhat verbose, and doesn't mix well with a shebang line like `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

An alternative is to avoid using relative imports, and just use...

    from mypackage.mymodule import as_int

Either way, you'll need to run from the parent of `mypackage`, or add that directory to `PYTHONPATH` (either one will ensure that `mypackage` is in the sys.path [module search path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys_path_init.html)). Or, if you want it to work "out of the box", you can frob the `PYTHONPATH` in code first with this...

    import sys
    import os
    
    SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
    sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(SCRIPT_DIR))

    from mypackage.mymodule import as_int

It's kind of a pain, but there's a clue as to why in [an email][1] written by a certain Guido van Rossum...

Whether running scripts inside a package is an antipattern or not is subjective, but personally I find it really useful in a package I have which contains some custom wxPython widgets, so I can run the script for any of the source files to display a `wx.Frame` containing only that widget for testing purposes.
