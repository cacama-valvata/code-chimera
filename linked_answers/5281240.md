Using the [`struct` module][1], you can take the wave frames (which are in [2's complementary][2] binary between -32768 and 32767 (i.e. `0x8000` and `0x7FFF`). This reads a MONO, 16-BIT, WAVE file. I found [this webpage][3] quite useful in formulating this:

    import wave, struct
    
    wavefile = wave.open('sine.wav', 'r')
    
    length = wavefile.getnframes()
    for i in range(0, length):
        wavedata = wavefile.readframes(1)
        data = struct.unpack("<h", wavedata)
        print(int(data[0]))

This snippet reads 1 frame. To read more than one frame (e.g., 13), use

    wavedata = wavefile.readframes(13)
    data = struct.unpack("<13h", wavedata)
