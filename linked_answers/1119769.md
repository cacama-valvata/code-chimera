There is no standard module for this, but I have written my own functions to achieve that.

<!-- language: lang-py -->

    BASE62 = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    
    def encode(num, alphabet):
        """Encode a positive number into Base X and return the string.
    
        Arguments:
        - `num`: The number to encode
        - `alphabet`: The alphabet to use for encoding
        """
        if num == 0:
            return alphabet[0]
        arr = []
        arr_append = arr.append  # Extract bound-method for faster access.
        _divmod = divmod  # Access to locals is faster.
        base = len(alphabet)
        while num:
            num, rem = _divmod(num, base)
            arr_append(alphabet[rem])
        arr.reverse()
        return ''.join(arr)
    
    def decode(string, alphabet=BASE62):
        """Decode a Base X encoded string into the number
    
        Arguments:
        - `string`: The encoded string
        - `alphabet`: The alphabet to use for decoding
        """
        base = len(alphabet)
        strlen = len(string)
        num = 0
    
        idx = 0
        for char in string:
            power = (strlen - (idx + 1))
            num += alphabet.index(char) * (base ** power)
            idx += 1
    
        return num

Notice the fact that you can give it any alphabet to use for encoding and decoding. If you leave the `alphabet` argument out, you are going to get the 62 character alphabet defined on the first line of code, and hence encoding/decoding to/from 62 base.

PS - For URL shorteners, I have found that it's better to leave out a few confusing characters like 0Ol1oI etc. Thus I use this alphabet for my URL shortening needs - `"23456789abcdefghijkmnpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ"`
