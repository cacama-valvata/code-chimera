The list comprehension is the most "pythonic" way.

The most "numpythonic" way would be:

    >>> data = np.array([['a','b'],['c','d']])
    # a 2D view
    >>> data.view('S2')
    array([['ab'],
           ['cd']], 
          dtype='|S2')
    # or maybe a 1D view ...fastest solution:
    >>> data.view('S2').ravel()
    array(['ab', 'cd'], 
          dtype='|S2')



No looping, no list comprehension, not even a copy.  The buffer just sits there unchanged with a different "view" so this is the fastest solution available.
