Yes it's in the POSIX shell grammar. You can also have **more than one here-doc for the same command** (some other examples use two `cat` invocations, but this works as well):

    cat <<EOF1 <<EOF2
    first here-doc
    EOF1
    second here-doc
    EOF2

This is contrived (using 2 here-docs for stdin), but if you think of providing input for different file descriptors it immediately makes sense.

There's also the possibility to **drop the `cat` entirely**. Why not make the here-document directly available to `cmd`:

    
    cmd << EOF
    input
    here
    EOF
