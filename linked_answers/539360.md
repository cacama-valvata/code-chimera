As you know, you can get the total_seconds from a timedelta object by accessing the `.seconds` attribute.

Python provides the builtin function `divmod()` which allows for:

<!-- language: lang-py -->

    s = 13420
    hours, remainder = divmod(s, 3600)
    minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)
    print('{:02}:{:02}:{:02}'.format(int(hours), int(minutes), int(seconds)))
    # result: 03:43:40

or you can convert to hours and remainder by using a combination of modulo and subtraction:

<!-- language: lang-py -->

    # arbitrary number of seconds
    s = 13420
    # hours
    hours = s // 3600 
    # remaining seconds
    s = s - (hours * 3600)
    # minutes
    minutes = s // 60
    # remaining seconds
    seconds = s - (minutes * 60)
    # total time
    print('{:02}:{:02}:{:02}'.format(int(hours), int(minutes), int(seconds)))
    # result: 03:43:40
