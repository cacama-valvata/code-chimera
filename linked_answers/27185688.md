There was an [issue on the Python bug tracker][1] about this:

> In some situations, the encoding of the command line is incorrect or
> unknown. sys.argv is decoded with the file system encoding which can
> be wrong. Eg. see issue #4388 (ok, it's a bug, it should be fixed).
> 
> As os.environb, it would be useful to have bytes version of sys.argv
> to have able to decide the encoding used to decode each argument, or
> to manipulate bytes if we don't care about the encoding.

Since on Python 3 `sys.argv` is encoded with the filesystem encoding, the proposed solution on the bug is to use [`os.fsencode`][2]:

    argvb = list(map(os.fsencode, sys.argv))

`os.fsencode` encodes the string using the string using the `surrogateescape` encoding, which is defined in [PEP-383][3].
