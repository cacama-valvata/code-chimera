One way I've seen is to pass a mutable object, such as a list or a dictionary, to the thread's constructor, along with a an index or other identifier of some sort. The thread can then store its results in its dedicated slot in that object.  For example:

    def foo(bar, result, index):
        print 'hello {0}'.format(bar)
        result[index] = "foo"
    
    from threading import Thread
    
    threads = [None] * 10
    results = [None] * 10
    
    for i in range(len(threads)):
        threads[i] = Thread(target=foo, args=('world!', results, i))
        threads[i].start()
    
    # do some other stuff
    
    for i in range(len(threads)):
        threads[i].join()
    
    print " ".join(results)  # what sound does a metasyntactic locomotive make?

If you really want `join()` to return the return value of the called function, you can do this with a `Thread` subclass like the following:

    from threading import Thread
    
    def foo(bar):
        print 'hello {0}'.format(bar)
        return "foo"

    class ThreadWithReturnValue(Thread):
        def __init__(self, group=None, target=None, name=None,
                     args=(), kwargs={}, Verbose=None):
            Thread.__init__(self, group, target, name, args, kwargs, Verbose)
            self._return = None
        def run(self):
            if self._Thread__target is not None:
                self._return = self._Thread__target(*self._Thread__args,
                                                    **self._Thread__kwargs)
        def join(self):
            Thread.join(self)
            return self._return

    twrv = ThreadWithReturnValue(target=foo, args=('world!',))
    
    twrv.start()
    print twrv.join()   # prints foo

That gets a little hairy because of some name mangling, and it accesses "private" data structures that are specific to `Thread` implementation... but it works.

For Python 3:

    class ThreadWithReturnValue(Thread):
        
        def __init__(self, group=None, target=None, name=None,
                     args=(), kwargs={}, Verbose=None):
            Thread.__init__(self, group, target, name, args, kwargs)
            self._return = None

        def run(self):
            if self._target is not None:
                self._return = self._target(*self._args,
                                                    **self._kwargs)
        def join(self, *args):
            Thread.join(self, *args)
            return self._return
