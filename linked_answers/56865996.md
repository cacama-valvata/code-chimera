Starting from SmartFomatter described above, I ended to that solution:

```
class SmartFormatter(argparse.HelpFormatter):
    '''
         Custom Help Formatter used to split help text when '\n' was 
         inserted in it.
    '''

    def _split_lines(self, text, width):
        r = []
        for t in text.splitlines(): r.extend(argparse.HelpFormatter._split_lines(self, t, width))
        return r
```

Note that strangely the formatter_class argument passed to top level parser is not inheritated by sub_parsers, one must pass it again for each created sub_parser.
