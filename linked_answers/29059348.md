If you want to group the `td` values by their `tr`, I would separate the xpath into two queries. One query selects the `<tr>` nodes and a second query selects the `<td>` childs of that node.

If you put that into a loop it can look like this:

    <?php
    
    $html = <<<EOF
    <div id="box">
    
        ... Your HTML comes here
    </tr>
    EOF;
    
    $url = '';
    $doc = new DOMDocument();
    $doc->preserveWhiteSpace = FALSE;
    @$doc->loadHTML($html);
    $xpath = new DOMXpath ($doc);
    $expresion = "//div[@id='box']//tr";
    $trs = $xpath->evaluate($expresion);
    foreach ($trs as $tr)
    {
        $tdvals = array();
        foreach($xpath->query('td', $tr) as $td) {
            /* Skip the td with the empty text value */
            if(trim($td->nodeValue) !== '') {
                $tdvals []= $td->nodeValue;
            }
        }
        echo implode(',', $tdvals) . PHP_EOL;
    }

which outputs:

<!-- language: none -->

    1,45,62
    2,35,47
    3,63,58

One another thing. In your example you are using `file_get_contents()` to load the HTML. Note that you can use `DOMDocument::loadHTMLFile()` to load (remote) files.
