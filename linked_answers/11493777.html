<p>I know this is a <strong>very</strong> old question, but I have never explicitly seen a satisfactory solution to this question other than the obvious, and most likely correct, answer to re-structure your code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not always practical to do such a thing, in which case as a very last resort, it <strong>is</strong> possible to pickle instances of classes which are defined inside another class. </p>

<p>The python documentation for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html?highlight=__reduce__#object.__reduce__" rel="noreferrer"><code>__reduce__</code> function</a> states that you can return</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A callable object that will be called to create the initial version of the object. The next element of the tuple will provide arguments for this callable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, all you need is an object which can return an instance of the appropriate class. This class <strong>must</strong> itself be picklable (hence, must live on the <code>__main__</code> level), and could be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>class _NestedClassGetter(object):
    """
    When called with the containing class as the first argument, 
    and the name of the nested class as the second argument,
    returns an instance of the nested class.
    """
    def __call__(self, containing_class, class_name):
        nested_class = getattr(containing_class, class_name)
        # return an instance of a nested_class. Some more intelligence could be
        # applied for class construction if necessary.
        return nested_class()
</code></pre>

<p>All that is left therefore, is to return the appropriate arguments in a <code>__reduce__</code> method on FloatType:</p>

<pre><code>class WidgetType(object):

    class FloatType(object):
        def __reduce__(self):
            # return a class which can return this class when called with the 
            # appropriate tuple of arguments
            return (_NestedClassGetter(), (WidgetType, self.__class__.__name__, ))
</code></pre>

<p>The result is a class which is nested but instances can be pickled (further work is needed to dump/load the <code>__state__</code> information, but this is relatively straightforward as per the <code>__reduce__</code> documentation).</p>

<p>This same technique (with slight code modifications) can be applied for deeply nested classes.</p>

<p>A fully worked example:</p>

<pre><code>import pickle


class ParentClass(object):

    class NestedClass(object):
        def __init__(self, var1):
            self.var1 = var1

        def __reduce__(self):
            state = self.__dict__.copy()
            return (_NestedClassGetter(), 
                    (ParentClass, self.__class__.__name__, ), 
                    state,
                    )


class _NestedClassGetter(object):
    """
    When called with the containing class as the first argument, 
    and the name of the nested class as the second argument,
    returns an instance of the nested class.
    """
    def __call__(self, containing_class, class_name):
        nested_class = getattr(containing_class, class_name)

        # make an instance of a simple object (this one will do), for which we can change the
        # __class__ later on.
        nested_instance = _NestedClassGetter()

        # set the class of the instance, the __init__ will never be called on the class
        # but the original state will be set later on by pickle.
        nested_instance.__class__ = nested_class
        return nested_instance



if __name__ == '__main__':

    orig = ParentClass.NestedClass(var1=['hello', 'world'])

    pickle.dump(orig, open('simple.pickle', 'w'))

    pickled = pickle.load(open('simple.pickle', 'r'))

    print type(pickled)
    print pickled.var1
</code></pre>

<p>My final note on this is to remember what the other answers have said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are in a position to do so, consider re-factoring your code to
  avoid the nested classes in the first place.</p>
