<p>Because it <em>is</em> a valid IPv4 address, as far as Microsoft's parsers are concerned.  The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms738563.aspx" rel="noreferrer"><code>inet_addr()</code></a> documentation explains this in more detail:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internet Addresses</p>
  
  <p>Values specified using the ".'' notation take one of the following forms:</p>
  
  <p>a.b.c.d <strong>a.b.c</strong> a.b a</p>
  
  <p>When four parts are specified, each is interpreted as a byte of data and assigned, from left to right, to the 4 bytes of an Internet address. When an Internet address is viewed as a 32-bit integer quantity on the Intel architecture, the bytes referred to above appear as "d.c.b.a''. That is, the bytes on an Intel processor are ordered from right to left.</p>
  
  <p>The parts that make up an address in "." notation can be decimal, octal or hexadecimal as specified in the C language. Numbers that start with "0x" or "0X" imply hexadecimal. Numbers that start with "0" imply octal. All other numbers are interpreted as decimal.</p>

Internet address value   Meaning
"4.3.2.16"               Decimal 
"004.003.002.020"        Octal 
"0x4.0x3.0x2.0x10"       Hexadecimal 
"4.003.002.0x10"         Mix 
</pre>
  
  <p>The inet_addr function supports the decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and mixed notations for the string passed in the cp parameter.</p>
  
  <p>Note  The following notations are only used by Berkeley software, and nowhere else on the Internet. For compatibility with Berkeley software, the inet_addr function also supports the additional notations specified below.</p>
  
  <p><strong>When a three-part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as a 16-bit quantity and placed in the right-most 2 bytes of the network address. This makes the three-part address format convenient for specifying Class B network addresses as "128.net.host"</strong></p>
  
  <p>When a two-part address is specified, the last part is interpreted as a 24-bit quantity and placed in the right-most 3 bytes of the network address. This makes the two-part address format convenient for specifying Class A network addresses as "net.host''.</p>
  
  <p>When only one part is given, the value is stored directly in the network address without any byte rearrangement.</p>
