Alright, I worked it out: an idea is to use the standard `multiprocessing` module and split the original array in just a few chunks (so as to limit communication overhead with the workers). This can be done relatively easily as follows:

    import multiprocessing

    import numpy as np

    def parallel_apply_along_axis(func1d, axis, arr, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Like numpy.apply_along_axis(), but takes advantage of multiple
        cores.
        """        
        # Effective axis where apply_along_axis() will be applied by each
        # worker (any non-zero axis number would work, so as to allow the use
        # of `np.array_split()`, which is only done on axis 0):
        effective_axis = 1 if axis == 0 else axis
        if effective_axis != axis:
            arr = arr.swapaxes(axis, effective_axis)
    
        # Chunks for the mapping (only a few chunks):
        chunks = [(func1d, effective_axis, sub_arr, args, kwargs)
                  for sub_arr in np.array_split(arr, multiprocessing.cpu_count())]
    
        pool = multiprocessing.Pool()
        individual_results = pool.map(unpacking_apply_along_axis, chunks)
        # Freeing the workers:
        pool.close()
        pool.join()
    
        return np.concatenate(individual_results)

where the function `unpacking_apply_along_axis()` being applied in `Pool.map()` is separate as it should (so that subprocesses can import it), and is simply a thin wrapper that handles the fact that `Pool.map()` only takes a single argument:

    def unpacking_apply_along_axis((func1d, axis, arr, args, kwargs)):
        """
        Like numpy.apply_along_axis(), but with arguments in a tuple
        instead.
    
        This function is useful with multiprocessing.Pool().map(): (1)
        map() only handles functions that take a single argument, and (2)
        this function can generally be imported from a module, as required
        by map().
        """
        return np.apply_along_axis(func1d, axis, arr, *args, **kwargs)

(in Python 3, the argument unpacking must be done manually:

    def unpacking_apply_along_axis(all_args):
        """…"""
        (func1d, axis, arr, args, kwargs) = all_args
        …

because [argument unpacking was removed][1]).

In my particular case, this resulted in a 2x speedup on 2 cores with hyper-threading. A factor closer to 4x would have been nicer, but the speed up is already nice, in just a few lines of code, and it should be better for machines with more cores (which are quite common). Maybe there is a way of avoiding data copies and using shared memory (maybe through the [`multiprocessing` module][2] itself)?
