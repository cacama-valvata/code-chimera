That won't quite work, because `MemoryHandler`'s `flush()` method doesn't check levels before sending them to the target - all buffered records are sent. However, you could use a filter on the target handler, as in this example:


    import logging, logging.handlers
    
    class WarningFilter(logging.Filter):
        def filter(self, record):
            return record.levelno >= logging.WARNING
    
    logger = logging.getLogger('foo')
    mh = logging.handlers.MemoryHandler(1000)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.addHandler(mh)
    logger.debug('bar')
    logger.warning('baz')
    sh = logging.StreamHandler()
    sh.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
    sh.addFilter(WarningFilter())
    mh.setTarget(sh)
    mh.flush()

When run, you should just see `baz` printed.
