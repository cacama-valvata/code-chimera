Thanks to the [nice answer][1] by [Adam][2], I was able to get this working. His solution didn't quite work for my case, since I needed to capture text, restore, and capture text again many times, so I had to make some pretty big changes. Also, I wanted to get this to work for sys.stderr as well (with the potential for other streams).

So, here is the solution I ended up using (with or without threading):

### Code

    import os
    import sys
    import threading
    import time
    
    
    class OutputGrabber(object):
        """
        Class used to grab standard output or another stream.
        """
        escape_char = "\b"
    
        def __init__(self, stream=None, threaded=False):
            self.origstream = stream
            self.threaded = threaded
            if self.origstream is None:
                self.origstream = sys.stdout
            self.origstreamfd = self.origstream.fileno()
            self.capturedtext = ""
            # Create a pipe so the stream can be captured:
            self.pipe_out, self.pipe_in = os.pipe()

        def __enter__(self):
            self.start()
            return self
    
        def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
            self.stop()
    
        def start(self):
            """
            Start capturing the stream data.
            """
            self.capturedtext = ""
            # Save a copy of the stream:
            self.streamfd = os.dup(self.origstreamfd)
            # Replace the original stream with our write pipe:
            os.dup2(self.pipe_in, self.origstreamfd)
            if self.threaded:
                # Start thread that will read the stream:
                self.workerThread = threading.Thread(target=self.readOutput)
                self.workerThread.start()
                # Make sure that the thread is running and os.read() has executed:
                time.sleep(0.01)
    
        def stop(self):
            """
            Stop capturing the stream data and save the text in `capturedtext`.
            """
            # Print the escape character to make the readOutput method stop:
            self.origstream.write(self.escape_char)
            # Flush the stream to make sure all our data goes in before
            # the escape character:
            self.origstream.flush()
            if self.threaded:
                # wait until the thread finishes so we are sure that
                # we have until the last character:
                self.workerThread.join()
            else:
                self.readOutput()
            # Close the pipe:
            os.close(self.pipe_in)
            os.close(self.pipe_out)
            # Restore the original stream:
            os.dup2(self.streamfd, self.origstreamfd)
            # Close the duplicate stream:
            os.close(self.streamfd)
    
        def readOutput(self):
            """
            Read the stream data (one byte at a time)
            and save the text in `capturedtext`.
            """
            while True:
                char = os.read(self.pipe_out,1).decode(self.origstream.encoding)
                if not char or self.escape_char in char:
                    break
                self.capturedtext += char


### Usage
with sys.stdout, the default:

    out = OutputGrabber()
    out.start()
    library.method(*args) # Call your code here
    out.stop()
    # Compare the output to the expected value:
    # comparisonMethod(out.capturedtext, expectedtext)

with sys.stderr:

    out = OutputGrabber(sys.stderr)
    out.start()
    library.method(*args) # Call your code here
    out.stop()
    # Compare the output to the expected value:
    # comparisonMethod(out.capturedtext, expectedtext)

in a `with` block:

    out = OutputGrabber()
    with out:
        library.method(*args) # Call your code here
    # Compare the output to the expected value:
    # comparisonMethod(out.capturedtext, expectedtext)

Tested with Python 3.10. To work in Python 2, change `char = os.read(self.pipe_out,1).decode(self.origstream.encoding)` to `char = os.read(self.pipe_out,1)`.
