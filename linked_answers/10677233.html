<p>Yes it's in the POSIX shell grammar. You can also have <strong>more than one here-doc for the same command</strong> (some other examples use two <code>cat</code> invocations, but this works as well):</p>

<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF1 &lt;&lt;EOF2
first here-doc
EOF1
second here-doc
EOF2
</code></pre>

<p>This is contrived (using 2 here-docs for stdin), but if you think of providing input for different file descriptors it immediately makes sense.</p>

<p>There's also the possibility to <strong>drop the <code>cat</code> entirely</strong>. Why not make the here-document directly available to <code>cmd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cmd &lt;&lt; EOF
input
here
EOF
</code></pre>
