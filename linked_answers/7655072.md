Have you considered using [BioPython][1]. They have a [sequence reader][2] that can read fasta files. And if you are interested in coding one yourself, you can take a look at [BioPython's code][3].

**Edit**: Code added

    def read_fasta(fp):
        name, seq = None, []
        for line in fp:
            line = line.rstrip()
            if line.startswith(">"):
                if name: yield (name, ''.join(seq))
                name, seq = line, []
            else:
                seq.append(line)
        if name: yield (name, ''.join(seq))
    
    with open('f.fasta') as fp:
        for name, seq in read_fasta(fp):
            print(name, seq)
