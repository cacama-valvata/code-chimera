[`logging.basicConfig()`][1] can take a keyword argument `handlers` since Python 3.3, which simplifies logging setup a lot, especially when setting up multiple handlers with the same formatter:

> **`handlers`** &ndash; If specified, this should be an iterable of already created handlers to add to the root logger. Any handlers which don’t already have a formatter set will be assigned the default formatter created in this function.

The whole setup can therefore be done with a single call like this:

<!-- language: python -->

    import logging
    
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format="%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s",
        handlers=[
            logging.FileHandler("debug.log"),
            logging.StreamHandler()
        ]
    )

(Or with `import sys` + `StreamHandler(sys.stdout)` per original question's requirements – the default for StreamHandler is to write to stderr. Look at [LogRecord attributes][2] if you want to customize the log format and add things like filename/line, thread info etc.)

The setup above needs to be done only once near the beginning of the script. You can use the logging from all other places in the codebase later like this:

<!-- language: python -->

    logging.info('Useful message')
    logging.error('Something bad happened')
    ...

Note: If it doesn't work, someone else has probably already initialized the logging system differently. Comments suggest doing `logging.root.handlers = []` before the call to `basicConfig()`.
