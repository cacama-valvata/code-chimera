Use a capturing group inside a lookahead. The lookahead captures the text you're interested in, but the actual match is technically the zero-width substring before the lookahead, so the matches are technically non-overlapping:

    import re 
    s = "123456789123456789"
    matches = re.finditer(r'(?=(\d{10}))', s)
    results = [int(match.group(1)) for match in matches]
    # results: 
    # [1234567891,
    #  2345678912,
    #  3456789123,
    #  4567891234,
    #  5678912345,
    #  6789123456,
    #  7891234567,
    #  8912345678,
    #  9123456789]
