<h2>Python 2.6+ and Python 3:</h2>
<p>If you want <code>StopIteration</code> to be raised if no matching element is found:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>next(x for x in the_iterable if x &gt; 3)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want <code>default_value</code> (e.g. <code>None</code>) to be returned instead:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>next((x for x in the_iterable if x &gt; 3), default_value)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you need an extra pair of parentheses around the generator expression in this case âˆ’ they are needed whenever the generator expression isn't the only argument.</p>
<p>I see most answers resolutely ignore the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#next" rel="noreferrer"><code>next</code></a> built-in and so I assume that for some mysterious reason they're 100% focused on versions 2.5 and older -- without mentioning the Python-version issue (but then I don't see that mention in the answers that <em>do</em> mention the <code>next</code> built-in, which is why I thought it necessary to provide an answer myself -- at least the &quot;correct version&quot; issue gets on record this way;-).</p>
<h2>Python &lt;= 2.5</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.5/ref/yieldexpr.html#l2h-407" rel="noreferrer"><code>.next()</code></a> method of iterators immediately raises <code>StopIteration</code> if the iterator immediately finishes -- i.e., for your use case, if no item in the iterable satisfies the condition.  If you don't care (i.e., you know there <strong>must</strong> be at least one satisfactory item) then just use <code>.next()</code> (best on a genexp, line for the <code>next</code> built-in in Python 2.6 and better).</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> care, wrapping things in a function as you had first indicated in your Q seems best, and while the function implementation you proposed is just fine, you could alternatively use <code>itertools</code>, a <code>for...: break</code> loop, or a genexp, or a <code>try/except StopIteration</code> as the function's body, as various answers suggested.  There's not much added value in any of these alternatives so I'd go for the starkly-simple version you first proposed.</p>
