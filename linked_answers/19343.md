In 2.x, [`zip`](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#zip) is its own inverse! Provided you [use the special * operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36901).
```
>>> zip(*[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)])
[('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), (1, 2, 3, 4)]
```
This is equivalent to calling `zip` with each element of the list as a separate argument:
```
zip(('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4))
```
except the arguments are passed to `zip` directly (after being converted to a tuple), so there's no need to worry about the number of arguments getting too big.

In 3.x, `zip` [returns a lazy iterator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27431390), but this is trivially converted:
```
>>> list(zip(*[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3), ('d', 4)]))
[('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), (1, 2, 3, 4)]
```
