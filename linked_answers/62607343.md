# TLDR; Use StereoSGBM (Semi Global Block Matching) and use some post filtering if you want it even smoother  

OP didn't provide original images, so I'm using `Tsukuba` from the [ Middlebury data set](https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/).

### Example of post filtering (see link below)

# Theory/Other considerations from OP's question    

The large black areas of your calibrated rectified images would lead me to believe that for those, calibration was not done very well. There's a variety of reasons that could be at play, maybe the physical setup, maybe lighting when you did calibration, etc., but there are plenty of camera calibration tutorials out there for that and my understanding is that you are asking for a way to get a better depth map from an uncalibrated setup (this isn't 100% clear, but the title seems to support this and I think that's what people will come here to try to find).

Your basic approach is correct, but the results can definitely be improved. This form of depth mapping is not among those that produce the highest quality maps (especially being uncalibrated). The biggest improvement will likely come from using a different stereo matching algorithm. The lighting may also be having a significant effect. The right image (at least to my naked eye) appears to be less well lit which could interfere with the reconstruction. You could first try brightening it to the same level as the other, or gather new images if that is possible. From here out, I'll assume you have no access to the original cameras, so I'll consider gathering new images, altering the setup, or performing calibration to be out of scope. (If you do have access to the setup and cameras, then I would suggest checking calibration and using a calibrated method as this will work better).

You used `StereoBM` for calculating your disparity (depth map) which does work, but `StereoSGBM` is much better suited for this application (it handles smoother edges better). You can see the difference below. 

[This article](https://medium.com/@omar.ps16/stereo-3d-reconstruction-with-opencv-using-an-iphone-camera-part-iii-95460d3eddf0) explains the differences in more depth: 

> Block matching focuses on high texture images (think a picture of a tree) and semi-global block matching will focus on sub pixel level matching and pictures with more smooth textures (think a picture of a hallway).

Without any explicit intrinsic camera parameters, specifics about the camera setup (like focal distance, distance between the cameras, distance to the subject, etc.), a known dimension in the image, or motion (to use [structure from motion](https://docs.opencv.org/master/de/d7c/tutorial_table_of_content_sfm.html)), you can only obtain 3D reconstruction up to a projective transform; you won't have a sense of scale or necessarily rotation either, but you can still generate a relative depth map. You will likely suffer from some barrel and other distortions which could be removed with proper camera calibration, but you can get reasonable results without it as long as the cameras arenâ€™t terrible (lens system isn't too distorted) and are set up pretty close to [canonical configuration](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Canonical-stereo-configuration-with-parallel-optical-axes_fig1_252293461) (which basically means they are oriented such that their optical axes are as close to parallel as possible, and their fields of view overlap sufficiently). This doesn't however appear to be the OPs issue as he did manage to get alright rectified images with the uncalibrated method.

# Basic Procedure  

1. Find at least 5 well-matched points in both images you can use to calculate the Fundamental Matrix (you can use any detector and matcher you like, I kept FLANN but used ORB to do detection as SIFT isn't in the main version of OpenCV for 4.2.0) 
2. Calculate the Fundamental Matrix, F, with `findFundamentalMat` 
3. Undistort your images with `stereoRectifyUncalibrated` and `warpPerspective` 
4. Calculate Disparity (Depth Map) with `StereoSGBM`

The results are much better:  

## Matches with ORB and FLANN  
[![Matches][5]][5]  

## Undistorted images (left, then right) 

[![undistorted left][6]][6]  
[![undistorted right][7]][7]  

## Disparity 

### StereoBM  

This result looks similar to the OPs problems (speckling, gaps, wrong depths in some areas). 

[![stereobm][1]][1]

### StereoSGBM (tuned)

This result looks much better and uses roughly the same method as the OP, minus the final disparity calculation, making me think the OP would see similar improvements on his images, had they been provided.

# Post filtering 

There's [a good article about this](https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/d3/d14/tutorial_ximgproc_disparity_filtering.html) in the OpenCV docs. I'd recommend looking at it if you need really smooth maps. 

The example photos above are frame 1 from the scene `ambush_2` in the [MPI Sintel Dataset](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/stereo).
