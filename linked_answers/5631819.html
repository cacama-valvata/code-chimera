<p><code>Popen.communicate</code> will set the <code>returncode</code> attribute when it's done(*). Here's the relevant documentation section:</p>

<pre><code>Popen.returncode 
  The child return code, set by poll() and wait() (and indirectly by communicate()). 
  A None value indicates that the process hasnâ€™t terminated yet.

  A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal N (Unix only).
</code></pre>

<p>So you can just do (I didn't test it but it should work):</p>

<pre><code>import subprocess as sp
child = sp.Popen(openRTSP + opts.split(), stdout=sp.PIPE)
streamdata = child.communicate()[0]
rc = child.returncode
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>(*) This happens because of the way it's implemented: after setting up threads to read the child's streams, it just calls <code>wait</code>. </p>
