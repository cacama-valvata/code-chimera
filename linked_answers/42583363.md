`pip` contains [code][1] for this (it's used by `pip freeze` to prefix the line with `-e`). Since `pip`'s API is not guaranteed to be stable, it's best to copy the code into the own application instead of importing it from `pip`:

    def dist_is_editable(dist):
        """Is distribution an editable install?"""
        for path_item in sys.path:
            egg_link = os.path.join(path_item, dist.project_name + '.egg-link')
            if os.path.isfile(egg_link):
                return True
        return False

The code is MIT-licensed so it should be safe to copy&paste into pretty much any project.
