Here's example code adapted from the [VerticalScrolledFrame][1] page on the **now defunct** [Tkinter Wiki][2] that's been modified to run on Python 2.7 and 3+.

It does not yet have the mouse wheel bound to the scrollbar but it is possible. Scrolling with the wheel can get a bit bumpy, though.

edit:

to 1)  
IMHO scrolling frames is somewhat tricky in Tkinter and does not seem to be done a lot. It seems there is no elegant way to do it.  
One problem with your code is that you have to set the canvas size manually - that's what the example code I posted solves.  

to 2)  
You are talking about the data function? Place works for me, too. (In general I prefer grid).  

to 3)   
Well, it positions the window on the canvas.   

One thing I noticed is that your example handles mouse wheel scrolling by default while the one I posted does not. Will have to look at that some time.
