Just call `drop()` against the table object.
From [the docs][1]: 

> Issue a DROP statement for this Table, using the given Connectable for connectivity.

In your case it should be:

    User.__table__.drop()

---
If you get an exception like:

>     sqlalchemy.exc.UnboundExecutionError: Table object 'my_users' is not bound to an Engine or Connection. Execution can not proceed without a database to execute against

You need to pass the engine:

    User.__table__.drop(engine)
