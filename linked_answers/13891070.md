The [`time.time()`][1] function returns the number of seconds since the epoch, as a float. Note that “[the epoch][2]” is defined as the start of January 1st, 1970 in UTC. So the epoch is defined in terms of UTC and establishes a global moment in time. No matter where on Earth you are, “seconds past epoch” (`time.time()`) returns the same value at the same moment.

Here is some sample output I ran on my computer, converting it to a string as well.

    >>> import time
    >>> ts = time.time()
    >>> ts
    1355563265.81
    >>> import datetime
    >>> datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(ts).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    '2012-12-15 01:21:05'
    >>>

The `ts` variable is the time returned in seconds. I then converted it to a human-readable string using the `datetime` library.
