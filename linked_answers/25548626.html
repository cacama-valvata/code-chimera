<p>SQL Server doesn't store a <code>DateTime</code> in any string format - it's stored as an 8 byte numerical value.</p>

<p>The various settings (language, date format) only influence how the <code>DateTime</code> is <strong>shown</strong> to you in SQL Server Management Studio - or how it is parsed when you attempt to convert a string to a <code>DateTime</code>. </p>

<p>There are many formats supported by SQL Server - see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187928.aspx" rel="nofollow">MSDN Books Online on CAST and CONVERT</a>. Most of those formats are dependent on what settings you have - therefore, these settings might work some times - and sometimes not.</p>

<p>The way to solve this is to use the (slightly adapted) <strong>ISO-8601 date format</strong> that is supported by SQL Server - this format works <strong>always</strong> - regardless of your SQL Server language and dateformat settings.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms180878.aspx" rel="nofollow">ISO-8601 format</a> is supported by SQL Server comes in two flavors:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>YYYYMMDD</code> for just dates (no time portion); note here: <strong>no dashes!</strong>, that's very important! <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> is <strong>NOT</strong> independent of the dateformat settings in your SQL Server and will <strong>NOT</strong> work in all situations!</li>
</ul>

<p>or:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS</code> for dates and times - note here: this format <em>has</em> dashes (but they <em>can</em> be omitted), and a fixed <code>T</code> as delimiter between the date and time portion of your <code>DATETIME</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is valid for SQL Server 2000 and newer.</p>

<p>If you use SQL Server 2008 or newer and the <code>DATE</code> datatype (only <code>DATE</code> - <strong>not</strong> <code>DATETIME</code>!), then you can indeed also use the <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format and that will work, too, with any settings in your SQL Server.</p>

<p>Don't ask me why this whole topic is so tricky and somewhat confusing - that's just the way it is. But with the <code>YYYYMMDD</code> format, you should be fine for any version of SQL Server and for any language and dateformat setting in your SQL Server.</p>

<p>The recommendation for SQL Server 2008 and newer is to use <code>DATE</code> if you only need the date portion, and <code>DATETIME2(n)</code> when you need both date and time. You should try to start phasing out the <code>DATETIME</code> datatype if ever possible</p>
