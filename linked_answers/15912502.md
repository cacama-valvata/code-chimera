There is no way to tell Sphinx to exclude some imports. When using autodoc, all documented modules must be cleanly importable. 

You might be able to work around the problem by doing some [mocking][1]. Here is an article describing the solution to a problem that seems quite similar to yours: http://blog.rtwilson.com/how-to-make-your-sphinx-documentation-compile-with-readthedocs-when-youre-using-numpy-and-scipy/. Here is a small code sample (intended to be added to conf.py):

    import mock
    
    MOCK_MODULES = ['numpy', 'matplotlib', 'matplotlib.pyplot']
    for mod_name in MOCK_MODULES:
        sys.modules[mod_name] = mock.Mock()

You might might need to install python-mock for the above to work: `sudo apt-get install python-mock`

### Update ###

Since Sphinx 1.3, it is easier to set up the mocking. Just add the modules to be mocked to the [`autodoc_mock_imports`][2] configuration value.
