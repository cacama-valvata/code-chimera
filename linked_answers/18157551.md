Here is a single formula that avoids all the case logic. (I happen to be working in JS right now, so here's a JS implementation). Let `rect = {max:{x:_, y:_}, min:{x:_, y:_}}` and `p={x:_, y:_}`

    function distance(rect, p) {
      var dx = Math.max(rect.min.x - p.x, 0, p.x - rect.max.x);
      var dy = Math.max(rect.min.y - p.y, 0, p.y - rect.max.y);
      return Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
    }

Explanation:
This breaks down the problem into calculating the x distance `dx` and the y distance `dy`. It then uses distance formula.

For calculating `dx`, here is how that works. (`dy` is analogous)

Look at the tuple being provided to the max function: `(min-p, 0, p-max)`. Let's designate this tuple `(a,b,c)`.

If p is left of min, then we have p < min < max, which means the tuple will evaluate to `(+,0,-)`, and so the max function will correctly return `a = min - p`.

If p is between min and max, then we have min < p < max, which means the tuple will evaluate to `(-,0,-)`. So again, the max function will correctly return `b = 0`.

Lastly, if p is to the right of max, then we have, min < max < p, and the tuple evaluates to `(-,0,+)`. Once again, Math.max correctly returns `c = p - max`.

So it turns out all the case logic is taken care of by Math.max, which leads to a nice 3-line, control-flow-free function.
