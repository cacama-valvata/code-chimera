Here's a generator that yields evenly-sized chunks:

```
def chunks(lst, n):
	"""Yield successive n-sized chunks from lst."""
	for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
		yield lst[i:i + n]
```

```
import pprint
pprint.pprint(list(chunks(range(10, 75), 10)))
[[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
 [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
 [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39],
 [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49],
 [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59],
 [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69],
 [70, 71, 72, 73, 74]]
```

For Python 2, using `xrange` instead of `range`:

	def chunks(lst, n):
		"""Yield successive n-sized chunks from lst."""
		for i in xrange(0, len(lst), n):
			yield lst[i:i + n]

Below is a list comprehension one-liner. The method above is preferable, though, since using named functions makes code easier to understand. For Python 3:

	[lst[i:i + n] for i in range(0, len(lst), n)]
	
For Python 2:

	[lst[i:i + n] for i in xrange(0, len(lst), n)]
