This handles C++-style comments, C-style comments, strings and simple nesting thereof.

        def replacer(match):
            s = match.group(0)
            if s.startswith('/'):
                return " " # note: a space and not an empty string
            else:
                return s
        pattern = re.compile(
            r'//.*?$|/\*.*?\*/|\'(?:\\.|[^\\\'])*\'|"(?:\\.|[^\\"])*"',
            re.DOTALL | re.MULTILINE
        )
        return re.sub(pattern, replacer, text)


Strings needs to be included, because comment-markers inside them does not start a comment.

**Edit:** re.sub didn't take any flags, so had to compile the pattern first.

**Edit2:** Added character literals, since they could contain quotes that would otherwise be recognized as string delimiters.

**Edit3:** Fixed the case where a legal expression `int/**/x=5;` would become `intx=5;` which would not compile, by replacing the comment with a space rather then an empty string.
