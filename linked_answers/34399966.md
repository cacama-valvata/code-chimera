If you want to "rename" an op, there is no way to do that directly, because a `tf.Operation` (or `tf.Tensor`) is immutable once it has been created. The typical way to rename an op is therefore to use `tf.identity()`, which has almost no runtime cost:

    with tf.name_scope("abc"):
        z = x + y
        z = tf.identity(z, name="z")

Note however that the recommended way to structure your name scope is to assign the name of the scope itself to the "output" from the scope (if there is a single output op):

    with tf.name_scope("abc") as scope:
        # z will get the name "abc". x and y will have names in "abc/..." if they
        # are converted to tensors.
        z = tf.add(x, y, name=scope)

This is how the TensorFlow libraries are structured, and it tends to give the best visualization in TensorBoard.
