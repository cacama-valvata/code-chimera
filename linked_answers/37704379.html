<p>It seems more pythonic to use a <code>for</code> loop.
See the quote from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#builtins" rel="noreferrer">Whatâ€™s New In Python 3.0</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removed <code>reduce()</code>. Use <code>functools.reduce()</code> if you really need it; however, 99 percent of the time an explicit <code>for</code> loop is more readable.</p>

<pre><code>def nested_get(dic, keys):    
    for key in keys:
        dic = dic[key]
    return dic

def nested_set(dic, keys, value):
    for key in keys[:-1]:
        dic = dic.setdefault(key, {})
    dic[keys[-1]] = value

def nested_del(dic, keys):
    for key in keys[:-1]:
        dic = dic[key]
    del dic[keys[-1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the accepted solution doesn't set non-existing nested keys (it raises <code>KeyError</code>). Using the approach above will create non-existing nodes instead.</p>
<p>The code works in both Python 2 and 3.</p>
