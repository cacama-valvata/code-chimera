Addressing the above "too small a task to require a library" issue by a straightforward implementation (using f-strings, so Python 3.6+):
```python
def sizeof_fmt(num, suffix="B"):
    for unit in ("", "Ki", "Mi", "Gi", "Ti", "Pi", "Ei", "Zi"):
        if abs(num) < 1024.0:
            return f"{num:3.1f}{unit}{suffix}"
        num /= 1024.0
    return f"{num:.1f}Yi{suffix}"
```
Supports:

* all currently known [binary prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Specific_units_of_IEC_60027-2_A.2_and_ISO.2FIEC_80000)
* negative and positive numbers
* numbers larger than 1000 Yobibytes
* arbitrary units (maybe you like to count in Gibibits!)

Example:
```
>>> sizeof_fmt(168963795964)
'157.4GiB'
```
