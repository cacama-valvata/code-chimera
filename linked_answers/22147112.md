Same issue. I am using vagrant, my host OS is Windows while the Gust OS is Ubuntu. I am not a vim fan, so @simo's answer does not help me much because I really rely on virtual box shared folders to sync changes made by sublime editor to the Ubuntu virtual machine.

Thanks to Fabian Kochem, he found a quick and dirty workaround: [post][1]

    # if you are not using vagrant, just delete os.link directly,
    # The hard link only saves a little disk space, so you should not care
    if os.environ.get('USER','') == 'vagrant':
        del os.link
