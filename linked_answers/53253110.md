What about [`sqlite3.Connection.backup(...)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.backup)? "This method makes a backup of a SQLite database even while itâ€™s being accessed by other clients, or concurrently by the same connection." Availability: SQLite 3.6.11 or higher. New in version 3.7.

    import sqlite3
    
    source = sqlite3.connect('existing_db.db')
    dest = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
    source.backup(dest)
